  abstract = {Uncertainty quantification (UQ) plays a pivotal role in the reduction of uncertainties during both optimization and decision making, applied to solve a variety of real-world applications in science and engineering. Bayesian approximation and ensemble learning techniques are two of the most widely-used UQ methods in the literature. In this regard, researchers have proposed different UQ methods and examined their performance in a variety of applications such as computer vision (e.g., self-driving cars and object detection), image processing (e.g., image restoration), medical image analysis (e.g., medical image classification and segmentation), natural language processing (e.g., text classification, social media texts and recidivism risk-scoring), bioinformatics, etc. This study reviews recent advances in UQ methods used in deep learning, investigates the application of these methods in reinforcement learning, and highlight the fundamental research challenges and directions associated with the UQ field.},

  abstract = {In min-min optimization or max-min optimization, one has to compute the gradient of a function defined as a minimum. In most cases, the minimum has no closed-form, and an approximation is obtained via an iterative algorithm. There are two usual ways of estimating the gradient of the function: using either an analytic formula obtained by assuming exactness of the approximation, or automatic differentiation through the algorithm. In this paper, we study the asymptotic error made by these estimators as a function of the optimization error. We find that the error of the automatic estimator is close to the square of the error of the analytic estimator, reflecting a super-efficiency phenomenon. The convergence of the automatic estimator greatly depends on the convergence of the Jacobian of the algorithm. We analyze it for gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent and derive convergence rates for the estimators in these cases. Our analysis is backed by numerical experiments on toy problems and on Wasserstein barycenter computation. Finally, we discuss the computational complexity of these estimators and give practical guidelines to chose between them.},

  abstract = {Chance constraint is an important tool for modeling the reliability on decision making in the presence of uncertainties. Indeed, the chance constraint enforces that the constraint is satisfied with probability 1 - {$\alpha$} ( 0 {$<$} {$\alpha$} {$<$} 1 ) at least. In addition, we consider that the objective func- tion is affected by uncertainties. This problem is challenging since modeling a complex system under uncertainty can be expensive and for most real-world stochastic optimization will not be computationally viable. In this talk, we propose a Bayesian methodology to efficiently solve such class of problems. The central idea is to use Gaussian Process (GP) models [1] together with appropriate acquisi- tion functions to guide the search for an optimal solution. We first show that by specifying a GP prior to the objective function, the loss function becomes tractable [2]. Similarly, using GP models for the constraints, the probability satisfaction can be efficiently approximated. Sub- sequently, we introduce new acquisition functions to iteratively select the points to query the expensive objective and constraint functions. Finally, we present numerical examples to validate our approach compared to benchmark results.},

Structure present in these problems allows efficient optimization strategies \textemdash{} a well known example is variable projection, where nonlinear least squares problems which are linear in some parameters can be very efficiently optimized. In this paper, we extend the idea of projecting out a subset over the variables to a broad class of maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum a posteriori likelihood (MAP) problems with nuisance parameters, such as variance or degrees of freedom. As a result, we are able to incorporate nuisance parameter estimation into large-scale constrained and unconstrained inverse problem formulations. We apply the approach to a variety of problems, including estimation of unknown variance parameters in the Gaussian model, degree of freedom (d.o.f.) parameter estimation in the context of robust inverse problems, automatic calibration, and optimal experimental design. Using numerical examples, we demonstrate improvement in recovery of primary parameters for several largescale inverse problems. The proposed approach is compatible with a wide variety of algorithms and formulations, and its implementation requires only minor modifications to existing algorithms.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose Deep Data Assimilation (DDA), an integration of Data Assimilation (DA) with Machine Learning (ML). DA is the Bayesian approximation of the true state of some physical system at a given time by combining time-distributed observations with a dynamic model in an optimal way. We use a ML model in order to learn the assimilation process. In particular, a recurrent neural network, trained with the state of the dynamical system and the results of the DA process, is applied for this purpose. At each iteration, we learn a function that accumulates the misfit between the results of the forecasting model and the results of the DA. Subsequently, we compose this function with the dynamic model. This resulting composition is a dynamic model that includes the features of the DA process and that can be used for future prediction without the necessity of the DA. In fact, we prove that the DDA approach implies a reduction of the model error, which decreases at each iteration; this is achieved thanks to the use of DA in the training process. DDA is very useful in that cases when observations are not available for some time steps and DA cannot be applied to reduce the model error. The effectiveness of this method is validated by examples and a sensitivity study. In this paper, the DDA technology is applied to two different applications: the Double integral mass dot system and the Lorenz system. However, the algorithm and numerical methods that are proposed in this work can be applied to other physics problems that involve other equations and/or state variables.},

  abstract = {For many applications, in particular in natural science, the task is to determine hidden system parameters from a set of measurements. Often, the forward process from parameter- to measurement-space is well-defined, whereas the inverse problem is ambiguous: multiple parameter sets can result in the same measurement. To fully characterize this ambiguity, the full posterior parameter distribution, conditioned on an observed measurement, has to be determined. We argue that a particular class of neural networks is well suited for this task \textendash{} so-called Invertible Neural Networks (INNs). Unlike classical neural networks, which attempt to solve the ambiguous inverse problem directly, INNs focus on learning the forward process, using additional latent output variables to capture the information otherwise lost. Due to invertibility, a model of the corresponding inverse process is learned implicitly. Given a specific measurement and the distribution of the latent variables, the inverse pass of the INN provides the full posterior over parameter space. We prove theoretically and verify experimentally, on artificial data and real-world problems from medicine and astrophysics, that INNs are a powerful analysis tool to find multi-modalities in parameter space, uncover parameter correlations, and identify unrecoverable parameters.},

Bayesian computation is straightforward via a simple Gibbs sampling algorithm. We also investigate the properties of the maximum a posteriori estimator and reveal connections with some well-established regularization procedures.

Minimizations required by implicit particle methods are shown to be similar to those that one encounters in variational data assimilation, and the connection of implicit particle methods with variational data assimilation is explored.

  abstract = {A new simulation approach, called `subset simulation', is proposed to compute small failure probabilities encountered in reliability analysis of engineering systems. The basic idea is to express the failure probability as a product of larger conditional failure probabilities by introducing intermediate failure events. With a proper choice of the conditional events, the conditional failure probabilities can be made suf\textregistered ciently large so that they can be estimated by means of simulation with a small number of samples. The original problem of calculating a small failure probability, which is computationally demanding, is reduced to calculating a sequence of conditional probabilities, which can be readily and ef\textregistered ciently estimated by means of simulation. The conditional probabilities cannot be estimated ef\textregistered ciently by a standard Monte Carlo procedure, however, and so a Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) technique based on the Metropolis algorithm is presented for their estimation. The proposed method is robust to the number of uncertain parameters and ef\textregistered cient in computing small probabilities.

Any future state can then be computed by placing the associated differential equation in an ODE solver. We first evaluate our approach on shallow water and Euler simulations. We find that our method not only demonstrates high quality long-term forecasts, but also learns to produce hidden states closely resembling the true states of the system, without direct supervision on the latter. Additional experiments conducted on challenging, state of the art ocean simulations further validate our findings, while exhibiting notable improvements over classical baselines.},

We adopt a Bayesian approach where the objective function is assumed to be a realization of a Gaussian random field. In this setting, the posterior distribution on the objective function gives rise to a posterior distribution on excursion sets. Several approaches exist to summarize the distribution of such sets based on random closed set theory. While the recently proposed Vorob'ev approach exploits analytical formulae, further notions of variability require Monte Carlo estimators relying on Gaussian random field conditional simulations. In the present work we propose a method to choose Monte Carlo simulation points and obtain quasi-realizations of the conditional field at fine designs through affine predictors. The points are chosen optimally in the sense that they minimize the posterior expected distance in measure between the excursion set and its reconstruction. The proposed method reduces the computational costs due to Monte Carlo simulations and enables the computation of quasi-realizations on fine designs in large dimensions. We apply this reconstruction approach to obtain realizations of an excursion set on a fine grid which allow us to give a new measure of uncertainty based on the distance transform of the excursion set. Finally we present a safety engineering test case where the simulation method is employed to compute a Monte Carlo estimate of a contour line.},

An immediate application can be found in portfolio optimization, when the matrix to be decomposed is the covariance between the different assets in the portfolio. Our approach consists in representing the low-rank part of the solution as the product M M T , where M is a rectangular matrix of appropriate size, parametrized by the coefficients of a deep neural network. We then use a gradient descent algorithm to minimize an appropriate loss function over the parameters of the network. We deduce its convergence rate to a local optimum from the Lipschitz smoothness of our loss function. We show that the rate of convergence grows polynomially in the dimensions of the input, output, and the size of each of the hidden layers.},

Transport maps or ``flows'' deterministically couple two distributions via an expressive monotone transformation. Yet, learning the parameters of such transformations in high dimensions is challenging given few samples from the unknown target distribution, and structural choices for these transformations can have a significant impact on performance. Here we formulate a systematic framework for representing and learning monotone maps, via invertible transformations of smooth functions, and demonstrate that the associated minimization problem has a unique global optimum. Given a hierarchical basis for the appropriate function space, we propose a sample-efficient adaptive algorithm that estimates a sparse approximation for the map. We demonstrate how this framework can learn densities with stable generalization performance across a wide range of sample sizes on real-world datasets.},

Mech. 2001) and our sequential Bayesian approach for the estimation of a probability of failure (Bect, Ginsbourger, Li, Picheny and Vazquez, Stat. Comput. 2012). This makes it possible to estimate {$\alpha$} when the number of evaluations of f is very limited and {$\alpha$} is very small. The resulting algorithm is called Bayesian subset simulation (BSS). A key idea, as in the subset simulation algorithm, is to estimate the probabilities of a sequence of excursion sets of f above intermediate thresholds, using a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) approach. A Gaussian process prior on f is used to define the sequence of densities targeted by the SMC algorithm, and drive the selection of evaluation points of f to estimate the intermediate probabilities. Adaptive procedures are proposed to determine the intermediate thresholds and the number of evaluations to be carried out at each stage of the algorithm. Numerical experiments illustrate that BSS achieves significant savings in the number of function evaluations with respect to other Monte Carlo approaches.},

In the industrial world, this corresponds to the problem of estimating a probability of failure of a system. When only an expensive-to-simulate model of the system is available, the budget for simulations is usually severely limited and therefore classical Monte Carlo methods ought to be avoided. One of the main contributions of this article is to derive SUR (stepwise uncertainty reduction) strategies from a Bayesian-theoretic formulation of the problem of estimating a probability of failure. These sequential strategies use a Gaussian process model of f and aim at performing evaluations of f as efficiently as possible to infer the value of the probability of failure. We compare these strategies to other strategies also based on a Gaussian process model for estimating a probability of failure.},

  abstract = {We show that standard ResNet architectures can be made invertible, allowing the same model to be used for classification, density estimation, and generation. Typically, enforcing invertibility requires partitioning dimensions or restricting network architectures. In contrast, our approach only requires adding a simple normalization step during training, already available in standard frameworks. Invertible ResNets define a generative model which can be trained by maximum likelihood on unlabeled data. To compute likelihoods, we introduce a tractable approximation to the Jacobian log-determinant of a residual block. Our empirical evaluation shows that invertible ResNets perform competitively with both stateof-the-art image classifiers and flow-based generative models, something that has not been previously achieved with a single architecture.},

This problem is challenging since modeling a complex system under uncertainty can be expensive and for most real-world problems robust optimization will not be computationally viable. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian methodology to efficiently solve a class of robust optimization problems that arise in engineering design under uncertainty. The central idea is to use Gaussian process models of loss functions (or robustness metrics) together with appropriate acquisition functions to guide the search for a robust optimal solution. Numerical studies on a test problem are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.},

  abstract = {Breakthroughs in machine learning are rapidly changing science and society, yet our fundamental understanding of this technology has lagged far behind. Indeed, one of the central tenets of the field, the bias-variance trade-off, appears to be at odds with the observed behavior of methods used in the modern machine learning practice. The bias-variance trade-off implies that a model should balance under-fitting and over-fitting: rich enough to express underlying structure in data, simple enough to avoid fitting spurious patterns. However, in the modern practice, very rich models such as neural networks are trained to exactly fit (i.e., interpolate) the data. Classically, such models would be considered over-fit, and yet they often obtain high accuracy on test data. This apparent contradiction has raised questions about the mathematical foundations of machine learning and their relevance to practitioners. In this paper, we reconcile the classical understanding and the modern practice within a unified performance curve. This "double descent" curve subsumes the textbook U-shaped bias-variance trade-off curve by showing how increasing model capacity beyond the point of interpolation results in improved performance. We provide evidence for the existence and ubiquity of double descent for a wide spectrum of models and datasets, and we posit a mechanism for its emergence. This connection between the performance and the structure of machine learning models delineates the limits of classical analyses, and has implications for both the theory and practice of machine learning.},

Searching the parameter space of deep architectures is a difficult optimization task, but learning algorithms such as those for Deep Belief Networks have recently been proposed to tackle this problem with notable success, beating the state-of-the-art in certain areas.

  abstract = {The 20th century began on an auspicious statistical note with the publication of Karl Pearson's (Philos. Mag. Ser. 50 (1900) 157) goodness-of-fit test, which is regarded as one of the most important scientific breakthroughs. The basic motivation behind this test was to see whether an assumed probability model adequately described the data at hand. Pearson (Philos. Trans. Roy. Soc. London Ser. A 185 (1894) 71) also introduced a formal approach to statistical estimation through his method of moments (MM) estimation. Ronald A. Fisher, while he was a third year undergraduate at the Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, suggested the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) procedure as an alternative to Pearson's MM approach. In 1922 Fisher published a monumental paper that introduced such basic concepts as consistency, efficiency, sufficiency\textemdash and even the term ``parameter'' with its present meaning. Fisher (Philos. Trans. Roy. Soc. London Ser. A 222 (1922) 309) provided the analytical foundation of MLE and studied its efficiency relative to the MM estimator. Fisher (J. Roy. Statist. Soc. 87 (1924a) 442) established the asymptotic equivalence of minimum {$\chi$}2 and ML estimators and wrote in favor of using minimum {$\chi$}2 method rather than Pearson's MM approach. Recently, econometricians have found working under assumed likelihood functions restrictive, and have suggested using a generalized version of Pearson's MM approach, commonly known as the GMM estimation procedure as advocated in Hansen (Econometrica 50 (1982) 1029). Earlier, Godambe (Ann. Math. Statist. 31 (1960) 1208) and Durbin (J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B 22 (1960) 139) developed the estimating function (EF) approach to estimation that has been proven very useful for many statistical models. A fundamental result is that score is the optimum EF. Ferguson (Ann. Math. Statist. 29 (1958) 1046) considered an approach very similar to GMM and showed that estimation based on the Pearson {$\chi$}2 statistic is equivalent to efficient GMM. Golan et al. (Maximum Entropy Econometrics: Robust Estimation with Limited Data. Wiley, New York, 1996) developed entropy-based formulation that allowed them to solve a wide range of estimation and inference problems in econometrics. More recently, Imbens et al. (Econometrica 66 (1998) 333), Kitamura and Stutzer (Econometrica 65 (1997) 861) and Mittelhammer et al. (Econometric Foundations. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2000) put GMM within the framework of empirical likelihood (EL) and maximum entropy (ME) estimation. It can be shown that many of these estimation techniques can be obtained as special cases of minimizing Cressie and Read (J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B 46 (1984) 440) power divergence criterion that comes directly from the Pearson (1900) {$\chi$}2 statistic. In this way we are able to assimilate a number of seemingly unrelated estimation techniques into a unified framework.},

  abstract = {Pour \'evaluer la rentabilit\'e d'une production en amont du lancement du processus de fabrication, la plupart des entreprises industrielles ont recours \`a la simulation num\'erique. Cela permet de tester virtuellement plusieurs configurations des param\`etres d'un produit donn\'e et de statuer quant \`a ses performances (i.e. les sp\'ecifications impos\'ees par le cahier des charges).  Afin de mesurer l'impact des fluctuations des proc\'ed\'es industriels sur les performances du produit, nous nous int\'eressons en particulier \`a l'estimation de sa probabilit\'e de d\'efaillance. Chaque simulation exigeant l'ex\'ecution d'un code de calcul complexe et co\^uteux, il n'est pas possible d'effectuer un nombre de tests suffisant pour estimer cette probabilit\'e via, par exemple, une m\'ethode Monte-Carlo. Sous la contrainte d'un nombre limit\'e d'appels au code, nous proposons deux m\'ethodes d'estimation tr\`es diff\'erentes. La premi\`ere s'appuie sur les principes de l'estimation bay\'esienne. Nos observations sont les r\'esultats de simulation num\'erique. La probabilit\'e de d\'efaillance est vue comme une variable al\'eatoire, dont la construction repose sur celle d'un processus al\'eatoire destin\'e \`a mod\'eliser le code de calcul co\^uteux. Pour d\'efinir correctement ce mod\`ele, on utilise la m\'ethode de krigeage. Conditionnellement aux observations, la loi a posteriori de la variable al\'eatoire, qui mod\'elise la probabilit\'e de d\'efaillance, est inaccessible. Pour apprendre sur cette loi, nous construisons des approximations des caract\'eristiques suivantes: esp\'erance, variance, quantiles... On utilise pour cela la th\'eorie des ordres stochastiques pour la comparaison de variables al\'eatoires et, plus particuli\`erement, l'ordre convexe. La construction d'un plan d'exp\'eriences optimal est assur\'ee par la mise en place d'une proc\'edure de planificationd'exp\'eriences s\'equentielle, bas\'ee sur le principe des strat\'egies SUR ("Stepwise Uncertainty Reduction"). La seconde m\'ethode est une proc\'edure it\'erative, particuli\`erement adapt\'ee au cas o\`u la probabilit\'e de d\'efaillance est tr\`es petite, i.e. l'\'ev\'enement redout\'e est rare. Le code de calcul co\^uteux est repr\'esent\'e par une fonction que l'on suppose lipschitzienne. \`A chaque it\'eration, cette hypoth\`ese est utilis\'ee pour construire des approximations, par d\'efaut et par exc\`es, de la probabilit\'e de d\'efaillance. Nous montrons que ces approximations convergent vers la valeur vraie avec le nombre d'it\'erations. En pratique, on les estime gr\^ace \`a la m\'ethode Monte-Carlo dite de "splitting". Les m\'ethodes que l'on propose sont relativement simples \`a mettre en \oe uvre et les r\'esultats qu'elles fournissent peuvent \^etre interpr\'et\'es sans difficult\'e. Nous les testons sur divers exemples, ainsi que sur un cas r\'eel provenant de la soci\'et\'e STMicroelectronics. Full text is available here: https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-02279258}

Under mild assumptions, SAA is both tractable and enjoys strong asymptotic performance guarantees. Similar guarantees, however, do not typically hold in finite samples. In this paper, we propose a modification of SAA, which we term Robust SAA, which retains SAA's tractability and asymptotic properties and, additionally, enjoys strong finite-sample performance guarantees. The key to our method is linking SAA, distributionally robust optimization, and hypothesis testing of goodness-of-fit. Beyond Robust SAA, this connection provides a unified perspective enabling us to characterize the finite sample and asymptotic guarantees of various other data-driven procedures that are based upon distributionally robust optimization. This analysis provides insight into the practical performance of these various methods in real applications. We present examples from inventory management and portfolio allocation, and demonstrate numerically that our approach outperforms other data-driven approaches in these applications.},

  abstract = {Graph neural networks (GNNs) are among the most powerful tools in deep learning. They routinely solve complex problems on unstructured networks, such as node classification, graph classification, or link prediction, with high accuracy. However, both inference and training of GNNs are complex, and they uniquely combine the features of irregular graph processing with dense and regular computations. This complexity makes it very challenging to execute GNNs efficiently on modern massively parallel architectures. To alleviate this, we first design a taxonomy of parallelism in GNNs, considering data and model parallelism, and different forms of pipelining. Then, we use this taxonomy to investigate the amount of parallelism in numerous GNN models, GNN-driven machine learning tasks, software frameworks, or hardware accelerators. We use the work-depth model, and we also assess communication volume and synchronization. We specifically focus on the sparsity/density of the associated tensors, in order to understand how to effectively apply techniques such as vectorization. We also formally analyze GNN pipelining, and we generalize the established Message-Passing class of GNN models to cover arbitrary pipeline depths, facilitating future optimizations. Finally, we investigate different forms of asynchronicity, navigating the path for future asynchronous parallel GNN pipelines. The outcomes of our analysis are synthesized in a set of insights that help to maximize GNN performance, and a comprehensive list of challenges and opportunities for further research into efficient GNN computations. Our work will help to advance the design of future GNNs.},

  abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo has proven a remarkable empirical success, but only recently have we begun to develop a rigorous under- standing of why it performs so well on difficult problems and how it is best applied in practice. Unfortunately, that understanding is con- fined within the mathematics of differential geometry which has limited its dissemination, especially to the applied communities for which it is particularly important. In this review I provide a comprehensive conceptual account of these theoretical foundations, focusing on developing a principled intuition behind the method and its optimal implementations rather of any ex- haustive rigor. Whether a practitioner or a statistician, the dedicated reader will acquire a solid grasp of how Hamiltonian Monte Carlo works, when it succeeds, and, perhaps most importantly, when it fails.},

This includes a detailed discussion on how to account for design uncertainties and how to measure robustness (i.e., how to evaluate robustness). The main focus will be on the different approaches to perform robust optimization in practice including the methods of mathematical programming, deterministic nonlinear optimization, and direct search methods such as stochastic approximation and evolutionary computation. It discusses the strengths and weaknesses of the different methods, thus, providing a basis for guiding the engineer to the most appropriate techniques. It also addresses performance aspects and test scenarios for direct robust optimization techniques.},

  abstract = {Advances in computing power enable more widespread use of the mode, which is a natural measure of central tendency since, as the most probable value, it is not influenced by the tails in the distribution. The properties of the half-sample mode, which is a simple and fast estimator of the mode of a continuous distribution, are studied. The half-sample mode is less sensitive to outliers than most other estimators of location, including many other low-bias estimators of the mode. Its breakdown point is one half, equal to that of the median. However, because of its finite rejection point, the half-sample mode is much less sensitive to outliers that are all either greater or less than the other values of the sample. This is confirmed by applying the mode estimator and the median to samples drawn from normal, lognormal, and Pareto distributions contaminated by outliers. It is also shown that the half-sample mode, in combination with a robust scale estimator, is a highly robust starting point for iterative robust location estimators such as Huber's M-estimator. The half-sample mode can easily be generalized to modal intervals containing more or less than half of the sample. An application of such an estimator to the finding of collision points in high-energy proton-proton interactions is presented.},

The median is often used instead of the mean for asymmetric data because it is closer to the mode and is insensitive to extreme values in the sample. However, the mode itself can be reliably estimated by first transforming the data into approximately normal data by raising the values to a real power, and then estimating the mean and standard deviation of the transformed data. With this method, two estimators of the mode of the original data are proposed: a simple estimator based on estimating the mean by the sample mean and the standard deviation by the sample standard deviation, and a more robust estimator based on estimating the mean by the median and the standard deviation by the standardized median absolute deviation.},

  abstract = {A major challenge in next-generation industrial applications is to improve numerical analysis by quantifying uncertainties in predictions. In this work we present a formulation of a fully nonlinear and dispersive potential flow water wave model with random inputs for the probabilistic description of the evolution of waves. The model is analyzed using random sampling techniques and non-intrusive methods based on generalized Polynomial Chaos (PC). These methods allow to accurately and efficiently estimate the probability distribution of the solution and require only the computation of the solution in different points in the parameter space, allowing for the reuse of existing simulation software. The choice of the applied methods is driven by the number of uncertain input parameters and by the fact that finding the solution of the considered model is computationally intensive. We revisit experimental benchmarks often used for validation of deterministic water wave models. Based on numerical experiments and assumed uncertainties in boundary data, our analysis reveals that some of the known discrepancies from deterministic simulation in comparison with experimental measurements could be partially explained by the variability in the model input. We finally present a synthetic experiment studying the variance based sensitivity of the wave load on an offshore structure to a number of input uncertainties. In the numerical examples presented the PC methods have exhibited fast convergence, suggesting that the problem is amenable to being analyzed with such methods.},

When paired with a newly developed heteroscedastic Gaussian process model, our dynamic design scheme facilitates learning of signal and noise relationships which can vary throughout the input space. We show that it does so efficiently, on both computational and statistical grounds. In addition to illustrative synthetic examples, we demonstrate performance on two challenging real-data simulation experiments, from inventory management and epidemiology.

We argue that a valid update of a prior belief distribution to a posterior can be made for parameters which are connected to observations through a loss function rather than the traditional likelihood function, which is recovered as a special case. Modern application areas make it increasingly challenging for Bayesians to attempt to model the true data-generating mechanism. For instance, when the object of interest is low dimensional, such as a mean or median, it is cumbersome to have to achieve this via a complete model for the whole data distribution. More importantly, there are settings where the parameter of interest does not directly index a family of density functions and thus the Bayesian approach to learning about such parameters is currently regarded as problematic. Our framework uses loss functions to connect information in the data to functionals of interest. The updating of beliefs then follows from a decision theoretic approach involving cumulative loss functions. Importantly, the procedure coincides with Bayesian updating when a true likelihood is known yet provides coherent subjective inference in much more general settings. Connections to other inference frameworks are highlighted.},

  abstract = {In the context of computer experiments, metamodels are largely used to represent the output of computer codes. Among these models, Gaussian process regression (kriging) is very efficient see e.g Snelson (2008). In high dimension that is with a large number of input variables , but with few observations the classical anisotropic kriging becomes inefficient and sometimes completely wrong. One way to overcome this drawback is to use the isotropic kernel which is more robust because it estimates not as many parameters. However this model is too restrictive. The aim of this paper is to construct a model between these two, that is at the same time a robust and a flexible model. These two skills are necessary for a model in high dimension. We propose a kernel which is an answer to these requests and that we call isotropic by group kernel. This kernel is a tensor product of few isotropic kernels built on well-chosen subgroup of variables. The number and the composition of the groups are found by an algorithm which explores different structures. The choice of the best model is based on the quality of prediction.},

Second, for the full nonlinear model, we estimate the mean energy for various types of random body forcing, highlighting the different impact on the overall dynamics of space-time white noises, trace class white-in-time and colored-in-space noises, point noises, additive noises or multiplicative noises.},

The dynamics of a model are learned from its observation and an ordinary differential equation 5 (ODE) representation of this model is inferred using a recursive nonlinear regression. Because the method is embedded in a Bayesian data assimilation framework, it can learn from partial and noisy observations of a state trajectory of the physical model.

To deal with partial and noisy observations in that endeavor, machine learning representations of the surrogate model can be used within a Bayesian data assimilation framework. However, these approaches require to consider long time series of observational data, meant to be assimilated all together. This paper investigates the possibility to learn both the dynamics and the state online, i.e. to update their estimates at any time, in particular when new observations are acquired. The estimation is based on the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) family of algorithms using a rather simple representation for the surrogate model and state augmentation. We consider the implication of learning dynamics online through (i) a global EnKF, (i) a local EnKF and (iii) an iterative EnKF and we discuss in each case issues and algorithmic solutions. We then demonstrate numerically the efficiency and assess the accuracy of these methods using one-dimensional, one-scale and two-scale chaotic Lorenz models.},

We provide a convergence analysis for a specifically structured L-SVD that acts as a regularisation method. In a more general setting, we investigate the topic of model reduction via data dimensionality reduction to obtain a regularised inversion. We present a promising direction for solving inverse problems in cases where the underlying physics are not fully understood or have very complex behaviour.

  abstract = {Abstract Oceanographic observations are limited by sampling rates, while ocean models are limited by finite resolution and high viscosity and diffusion coefficients. Therefore both data from observations and ocean models lack information at small- and fast-scales. Methods are needed to either extract information, extrapolate, or up-scale existing oceanographic datasets, to account for or represent unresolved physical processes. Here we use machine learning to leverage observations and model data by predicting unresolved turbulent processes and sub-surface flow fields. As a proof-of-concept, we train convolutional neural networks on degraded-data from a high-resolution quasi-geostrophic ocean model. We demonstrate that convolutional neural networks successfully replicate the spatio-temporal variability of the sub-grid eddy momentum forcing, are capable of generalising to a range of dynamical behaviours, and can be forced to respect global momentum conservation. The training data of our convolutional neural networks can be sub-sampled to 10-20\% of the original size without a significant decrease in accuracy. We also show that the sub-surface flow field can be predicted using only information at the surface (e.g., using only satellite altimetry data). Our study indicates that data-driven approaches can be exploited to predict both sub-grid and large-scale processes, while respecting physical principles, even when data is limited to a particular region or external forcing.

Less work has been done to quantify the importance of nonlinearities in operational, state-of-the-art global data assimilation systems. In this paper we analyse the nonlinear effects present in ECMWF 4D-Var and evaluate the ability of the incremental formulation to solve the nonlinear assimilation problem in a realistic NWP environment. We find that nonlinearities have increased over the years due to a combination of increased model resolution and the ever-growing importance of observations that are nonlinearly related to the state. Incremental 4D-Var is well suited for dealing with these nonlinear effects, but at the cost of increasing the number of outer loop relinearisations. We then discuss strategies for accommodating the increasing number of sequential outer loops in the tight schedules of operational global NWP.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {We propose a framework to compute predictions based on an economic model when the model may be misspecified. Our approach relies on minimizing sensitivity of the estimates to the type of misspecification that is most influential for the parameter of interest. We rely on a local asymptotic approach where the degree of misspecification is indexed by the sample size. This results in simple rules to adjust the predictions from the reference model. We calibrate the degree of misspecification using a detection error probability approach, which allows us to perform systematic sensitivity analysis in both point-identified and partially-identified settings. We study three examples: demand analysis, treatment effects estimation under selection on observables, and panel data models where the distribution of individual effects may be misspecified and the number of time periods is small.},

Since the manual exploration of the parameter space is tedious -- even for few parameters -- several automatic procedures for parameter tuning have been proposed. Recent approaches also take into account some characteristic properties of the problem instances, frequently termed instance features. Our contribution is the proposal of a novel concept for feature-based algorithm parameter tuning, which applies an approximating surrogate model for learning the continuous feature-parameter mapping. To accomplish this, we learn a joint model of the algorithm performance based on both the algorithm parameters and the instance features. The required data is gathered using a recently proposed acquisition function for model refinement in surrogate-based optimization: the profile expected improvement. This function provides an avenue for maximizing the information required for the feature-parameter mapping, i.e., the mapping from instance features to the corresponding optimal algorithm parameters. The approach is validated by applying the tuner to exemplary evolutionary algorithms and problems, for which theoretically grounded or heuristically determined feature-parameter mappings are available.},

The new hybrid approach is designed for a two-fold scope: (i) emulating hidden, possibly chaotic, dynamics and (ii) predicting their future states. The method consists in applying iteratively a data assimilation step, here an ensemble Kalman filter, and a neural network. Data assimilation is used to optimally combine a surrogate model with sparse noisy data. The output analysis is spatially complete and is used as a training set by the neural network to update the surrogate model. The two steps are then repeated iteratively. Numerical experiments have been carried out using the chaotic 40-variables Lorenz 96 model, proving both convergence and statistical skill of the proposed hybrid approach. The surrogate model shows short-term forecast skill up to two Lyapunov times, the retrieval of positive Lyapunov exponents as well as the more energetic frequencies of the power density spectrum. The sensitivity of the method to critical setup parameters is also presented: the forecast skill decreases smoothly with increased observational noise but drops abruptly if less than half of the model domain is observed. The successful synergy between data assimilation and machine learning, proven here with a low-dimensional system, encourages further investigation of such hybrids with more sophisticated dynamics.},

In most cases, the ML training leverages high-resolution simulations to provide a dense, noiseless target state. Our goal is to go beyond the use of high-resolution simulations and train ML-based parametrization using direct data, in the realistic scenario of noisy and sparse observations. The algorithm proposed in this work is a two-step process. First, data assimilation (DA) techniques are applied to estimate the full state of the system from a truncated model. The unresolved part of the truncated model is viewed as a model error in the DA system. In a second step, ML is used to emulate the unresolved part, a predictor of model error given the state of the system. Finally, the ML-based parametrization model is added to the physical core truncated model to produce a hybrid model. The DA component of the proposed method relies on an ensemble Kalman filter while the ML parametrization is represented by a neural network. The approach is applied to the two-scale Lorenz model and to MAOOAM, a reduced-order coupled ocean-atmosphere model. We show that in both cases, the hybrid model yields forecasts with better skill than the truncated model. Moreover, the attractor of the system is significantly better represented by the hybrid model than by the truncated model.

This paper proposes a methodology to produce a hybrid model combining a physical-based model (forecasting the well-known processes) with a neural-net model trained from observations (forecasting the remaining processes). The approach is applied to a shallow-water model in which the forcing, dissipative and diffusive terms are assumed to be unknown. We show that the hybrid model is able to reproduce with great accuracy the unknown terms (correlation close to 1). For long term simulations it reproduces with no significant difference the mean state, the kinetic energy, the potential energy and the potential vorticity of the system. Lastly it is able to function with new forcings that were not encountered during the training phase of the neural network.},

  abstract = {For mildly nonlinear systems, involving concave diagonal nonlinearities, semi-global monotone convergence of Newton's method is guarantied provided that the Jacobian of the system is an M-matrix. However, regardless this convergence result, the efficiency of Newton's method becomes poor for stiff nonlinearities. We propose a nonlinear pre-conditioning procedure inspired by the Jacobi method and resulting in a new system of equations, which can be solved by Newton's method much more efficiently. The obtained preconditioned method is shown to exhibit semi-global convergence.},

In a second part, we propose some simple and efficient numerical schemes to approximate the solutions, and we provide numerical 2D and 3D experiments that illustrate the interest of our model in comparison with other Cahn--Hilliard models.},

The model uses only two factors, depth and velocity, to calculate quality and a third factor, width to quantify utility. The implementations were based on 3 multi-criteria evaluation approaches: Weighted Average, Fuzzy Sets and Bayesian probability. There was broad agreement between the formulations but important differences in detail. The model outputs indicate that uncertainty arising from model formulation is significant and can have a bearing on planning decisions. There is a complex interaction between the formulations and the characteristics of the sites. Suitability models should be used thoughtfully and implemented in ways that: facilitate exploratory analysis; present ranges of possible outputs; present indicators of uncertainty; and facilitate back tracking to explain the outputs.},

C'est \'egalement une articulation complexe, compos\'ee de huit petits os carpiens, qui sont connect\'es aux cinq m\'etacarpes et aux deux os de l'avant-bras. La complexit\'e de l'articulation est non seulement due \`a ce grand nombre d'os, mais \'egalement \`a la petite taille des os carpiens et \`a leurs formes \'elabor\'ees, qui rendent le mouvement des os les uns autour des autres \'egalement complexe. Dans cette th\`ese, nous nous sommes int\'eress\'es \`a la mod\'elisation 3D de la forme des os. Peu de travaux ont \'et\'e men\'es jusqu'\`a pr\'esent sur la mod\'elisation des os du poignet, et peu de donn\'ees exploitables pour des mod\`eles informatiques ont \'et\'e collect\'ees. Or de tels mod\`eles informatiques peuvent avoir de nombreuses applications : ils peuvent servir de base pour la cr\'eation d'outils informatiques automatis\'es ou encore \^etre int\'egr\'es dans des logiciels servant de support au diagnostique. La qualit\'e des r\'esultats de telles applications d\'epend de la qualit\'e du mod\`ele utilis\'e. C'est pourquoi nous attachons une attention particuli\`ere \`a la validation de notre travail, alors m\^eme qu'il n'existe pas de mesure directes pour l'\'evaluation, et qu'il faut utiliser des m\'etriques indirectes.Nous nous sommes int\'eress\'es \`a des outils pour la mod\'elisation 3D, particuli\`erement aux techniques de correspondance entre maillages. Nous pr\'esentons une m\'ethode pour transformer des maillages bruts directement cr\'e\'es \`a partir de tomodensitogrammes en nouveaux maillages repr\'esentant les m\^emes os tout en d\'efinissant des relations de correspondance. \%Une telle proc\'edure de remaillage n'est pas triviale \`a d\'efinir ni \`a valider, c'est pourquoi nous y portons une attention particuli\`ere.Une fois d\'efinies, ces relations rendent possible de nombreuses applications, qui permettent une validation suppl\'ementaire des correspondances. Nous pr\'esentons plusieurs applications. La variabilit\'e de la forme des os est analys\'ee \`a l'aide d'outils statistiques tels que l'Analyse en Composantes Principales (ACP) ainsi qu'un outil bas\'e sur les Processus Gaussiens.Les capacit\'es d'adaptation du mod\`ele ACP \`a de nouvelles formes sont utilis\'ees pour d\'efinir des relations de correspondance avec une seconde base de donn\'ees. Nous proposons \'egalement une m\'ethode pour transf\'erer simplement des syst\`emes de coordonn\'ees ou tout autre point remarquable d\'efinis pour quelques exemples vers le reste de la base de donn\'ees. Une telle application est utile pour des \'etudes biom\'ecaniques de mouvement du poignet. Finalement, dans une derni\`ere \'etape, nous nous sommes int\'eress\'es \`a la mod\'elisation des mouvements des os du poignet \`a l'aide d'un mod\`ele param\'etrique bas\'e sur des pr\'edicteurs significatifs et facilement mesurables.},

The exact notion of near-optimum is intertwined with the proposed similarity measure. Our similarity measure also allows us to derive formal statements about the expected quality of the computed solution. Furthermore, we apply our approach to various optimization problems.},

It can be considered a continuum-armed-bandit problem, with noiseless data, and simple regret. Expected-improvement algorithms are perhaps the most popular methods for solving the problem; in this paper, we provide theoretical results on their asymptotic behaviour. Implementing these algorithms requires a choice of Gaussian-process prior, which determines an associated space of functions, its reproducing-kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). When the prior is fixed, expected improvement is known to converge on the minimum of any function in its RKHS. We provide convergence rates for this procedure, optimal for functions of low smoothness, and describe a modified algorithm attaining optimal rates for smoother functions.},

The motivation for this work stems from supervised machine learning applications involving a very large number of training points. We follow a batch approach, also known in the stochastic optimization literature as a sample average approximation (SAA) approach. Curvature information is incorporated in two sub-sampled Hessian algorithms, one based on a matrix-free inexact Newton iteration and one on a preconditioned limited memory BFGS iteration. A crucial feature of our technique is that Hessian-vector multiplications are carried out with a significantly smaller sample size than is used for the function and gradient. The efficiency of the proposed methods is illustrated using a machine learning application involving speech recognition.}

We suggest that the most relevant contribution of the MCEM methodology is what we call the simulated annealing MCEM algorithm, which turns out to be very close to SAEM. We focus particularly on the mixture of distributions problem. In this context, we review the available theoretical results on the convergence of these algorithms and on the behavior of SEM as the sample size tends to infinity. The second part is devoted to intensive Monte Carlo numerical simulations and a real data study. We show that, for some particular mixture situations, the SEM algorithm is almost always preferable to the EM and simulated annealing versions SAEM and MCEM. For some very intricate mixtures, however, none of these algorithms can be confidently used. Then, SEM can be used as an efficient data exploratory tool for locating significant maxima of the likelihood function. In the real data case, we show that the SEM stationary distribution provides a contrasted view of the loglikelihood by emphasizing sensible maxima.},

  abstract = {Kernel estimators using non-negative kernels are considered to estimate probability density functions with compact supports. The kernels are chosen from a family of beta densities. The beta kernel estimators are free of boundary bias, non-negative and achieve the optimal rate of convergence for the mean integrated squared error. The proposed beta kernel estimators have two features. One is that the different amount of smoothing is allocated by naturally varying kernel shape without explicitly changing the value of the smoothing bandwidth. Another feature is that the support of the beta kernels can match the support of the density function; this leads to larger effective sample sizes used in the density estimation and can produce density estimates that have smaller finite-sample variance than some other estimators.},

  abstract = {In Bayesian inference, a joint posterior distribution is available through the likelihood function and a prior distribution. One purpose of Bayesian inference is to calculate and display marginal posterior densities because the marginal posterior densities provide complete information about parameters of interest. As shown in Chapter 2, a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithm, such as the Gibbs sampler or a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, can be used to draw MCMC samples from the posterior distribution. Chapter 3 also demonstrates how we can easily obtain posterior quantities such as posterior means, posterior standard deviations, and other posterior quantities from MCMC samples. However, when a Bayesian model becomes complicated, it may be difficult to obtain a reliable estimator of a marginal posterior density based on the MCMC sample. A traditional method for estimating marginal posterior densities is kernel density estimation. Since the kernel density estimator is nonparametric, it may not be efficient. On the other hand, the kernel density estimator may not be applicable for some complicated Bayesian models. In the context of Bayesian inference, the joint posterior density is typically known up to a normalizing constant. Using the structure of a posterior density, a number of authors (e.g., Gelfand, Smith, and Lee 1992; Johnson 1992; Chen 1993 and 1994; Chen and Shao 1997c; Chib 1995; Verdinelli and Wasserman 1995) propose parametric marginal posterior density estimators based on the MCMC sample. In this chapter, we present several available Monte Carlo (MC) methods for computing marginal posterior density estimators, and we also discuss how well marginal posterior density estimation works using the Kullback\textemdash Leibler (K\textemdash L) divergence as a performance measure.},

This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the advantage of the Gauss\textendash Newton Hessian matrix. It is proved that the Gauss\textendash Newton approximation function is the only nonnegative convex quadratic approximation that retains a critical property of the original objective function: taking the minimal value of zero on an \$(n-1)\$-dimensional manifold (or affine subspace). Due to this property, the Gauss\textendash Newton approximation does not change the zero-on-\$(n-1)\$-D ``structure'' of the original problem, explaining the reason why the Gauss\textendash Newton Hessian matrix is preferred for nonlinear least squares problems, especially when the initial point is far from the solution.},

This is a nontrivial extension because it requires a delicate analysis of the entropy of the semiparametric models involved. We find that the accuracy of inferences based on the profile sampler improves as the convergence rate of the nuisance parameter increases. Simulation studies are used to verify this theoretical result. We also establish that an exact frequentist confidence interval obtained by inverting the profile log-likelihood ratio can be estimated with higher-order accuracy by the credible set of the same type obtained from the posterior profile distribution.

  abstract = {Reduced-order modelling and low-dimensional surrogate models generated using machine learning algorithms have been widely applied in high-dimensional dynamical systems to improve the algorithmic efficiency. In this paper, we develop a system which combines reduced-order surrogate models with a novel data assimilation (DA) technique used to incorporate real-time observations from different physical spaces. We make use of local smooth surrogate functions which link the space of encoded system variables and the one of current observations to perform variational DA with a low computational cost. The new system, named Generalised Latent Assimilation can benefit both the efficiency provided by the reduced-order modelling and the accuracy of data assimilation. A theoretical analysis of the difference between surrogate and original assimilation cost function is also provided in this paper where an upper bound, depending on the size of the local training set, is given. The new approach is tested on a high-dimensional CFD application of a two-phase liquid flow with non-linear observation operators that current Latent Assimilation methods can not handle. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed assimilation approach can significantly improve the reconstruction and prediction accuracy of the deep learning surrogate model which is nearly 1000 times faster than the CFD simulation.}

We propose a new combination of a covariance tuning algorithm with existing PCA-type data compression approaches, either observation- or information-based, with the aim of reducing the computational cost of real-time updating at each assimilation step. Relying on a local assumption of flow-independent error covariances, dynamical assimilation residuals are used to adjust the covariance in each assimilation window. The estimated covariances then contribute to better specify the principal components of either the observation dynamics or the state-observation sensitivity. The proposed approaches are first validated on a shallow water twin experiment with correlated and non-homogeneous observation error. Proper selection of flow-independent assimilation windows, together with sampling density for background error estimation, and sensitivity of the approaches to the observations error covariance knowledge, are also discussed and illustrated with various numerical tests and results. The method is then applied to a more challenging industrial hydrological model with real-world data and non-linear transformation operator provided by an operational precipitation-flow simulation software.},

For reliability optimization design with uncertain parameters, based on the non-probabilistic reliability theory, robust design and optimal design method, the uncertain parameters of mechanical components are expressed by non-probabilistic interval variables, and a non-probabilistic measure and procedure for robust reliability computation is presented. Compared with the conventional probabilistic reliability optimization approach, the proposed method does not require a presumed probability distribution of the uncertain parameters and only the bounds or ranges of their variations are required. The optimal design for non-probabilistic robust reliability is formulated as a two level optimization problem, in which the first level minimizes the original robust optimal objective with the constraints of non-probabilistic reliability index, and the secondary level is used to identify the reliability index. The purpose of it is to get a tradeoff between the design objective and the robustness to uncertainties and satisfy the requirements for reliability. For instance, the robust reliability optimization of unidirectional wedge-typed overrunning clutch is proposed, and the results show that the proposed method is useful for mechanical components design and quality improvement.},

Neural networks offer a promising approach for the data-driven creation of surrogate models. The accuracy of the surrogate 4D-Var problem's solution has been shown to depend explicitly on accurate modeling of the forward and adjoint for other surrogate modeling approaches and in the general nonlinear setting. We formulate and analyze several approaches to incorporating derivative information into the construction of neural network surrogates. The resulting networks are tested on out of training set data and in a sequential data assimilation setting on the Lorenz-63 system. Two methods demonstrate superior performance when compared with a surrogate network trained without adjoint information, showing the benefit of incorporating adjoint information into the training process.},

In this work, we extend diffusion solvers to efficiently handle general noisy (non)linear inverse problems via the Laplace approximation of the posterior sampling. Interestingly, the resulting posterior sampling scheme is a blended version of diffusion sampling with the manifold constrained gradient without a strict measurement consistency projection step, yielding a more desirable generative path in noisy settings compared to the previous studies. Our method demonstrates that diffusion models can incorporate various measurement noise statistics such as Gaussian and Poisson, and also efficiently handle noisy nonlinear inverse problems such as Fourier phase retrieval and non-uniform deblurring.},

As a remedy to this limitation for the multi-objective formulation of moments,  a novel OUU formulation is proposed\textemdash dominance optimization. This formulation  seeks a set of solutions and makes use of global optimizers, so is useful for early  stages of the design process when exploration of design space is important.    Similarly, to address this limitation for the single-objective formulation of  moments (combining moments via a weighted sum), a second novel formulation  is proposed\textemdash horsetail matching. This formulation can make use of gradient-  based local optimizers, so is useful for later stages of the design process when  exploitation of a region of design space is important. Additionally, horsetail  matching extends straightforwardly to different representations of uncertainty,  and is flexible enough to emulate several existing OUU formulations.    Existing multi-fidelity methods for OUU are not compatible with these novel  formulations, so one such method\textemdash information reuse\textemdash is generalized to be  compatible with these and other formulations.    The proposed formulations, along with generalized information reuse, are  compared to their most comparable equivalent in the current state-of-the-art  on practical design problems: transonic aerofoil design, coupled aero-structural  wing design, high-fidelity 3D wing design, and acoustic horn shape design.    Finally, the two novel formulations are combined in a two-step design process,  which is used to obtain a robust design in a challenging version of the acoustic horn  design problem. Dominance optimization is given half the computational budget  for exploration; then horsetail matching is given the other half for exploitation.  Using exactly the same computational budget as a moment-based approach, the  design obtained using the novel formulations is 95\% more likely to achieve a  better QOI than the best value achievable by the moment-based design.},

Existing approaches for optimization under these types of uncertainty mostly rely on treating combinations of statistical moments as separate objectives, but this can give rise to stochastically dominated designs. Here, horsetail matching is extended for use with these types of uncertainties to overcome some of the limitations of existing approaches. The formulation delivers a single, differentiable metric as the objective function for optimization. It is demonstrated on algebraic test problems, the design of a wing using a low-fidelity coupled aerostructural code, and the aerodynamic shape optimization of a wing using computational fluid dynamics analysis.},

Often, this is done by considering statistical moments, but over-reliance on statistical moments when formulating a robust optimization can produce designs that are stochastically dominated by other feasible designs. This article instead proposes a formulation for optimization under uncertainty that minimizes the difference between a design's cumulative distribution function and a target. A standard target is proposed that produces stochastically non-dominated designs, but the formulation also offers enough flexibility to recover existing approaches for robust optimization. A numerical implementation is developed that employs kernels to give a differentiable objective function. The method is applied to algebraic test problems and a robust transonic airfoil design problem where it is compared to multi-objective, weighted-sum and density matching approaches to robust optimization; several advantages over these existing methods are demonstrated.},

  abstract = {Fluvial flooding is a costly problem in the UK and worldwide. Real-time accurate inundation forecasting can help to reduce the damage caused by inundation events by alerting people to take necessary mitigating actions. This work is part of an effort to improve inundation forecasting using data assimilation (DA). DA is a method for combining a numerical model of a system with observations in order to best estimate the current state of the system. A river inundation model has been developed using numerical implementation of the shallow water equations with an inflow source term added; the model and implementation of the source term are described here. The model has then been used with idealised river valley topographies in order to investigate the sensitivities of the system to model parameters describing the effect of friction between water and the river channel, and the effect of the topography slope at the downstream boundary. Initial DA experiments using an ensemble Kalman Filter are also described. Identical twin experiments show that the DA as implemented in this domain can correct the water levels at the time of the observations, and that more observations lead to a better correction. However, by the time of the next observations very similar water levels are predicted, regardless of the number of observations used in the assimilation. This implies that the effective time for observations in this system is small compared to the time between observations.},

The method can be extended to Lagrangian particle methods such as Hamiltonian particle\textendash mesh and smooth-particle hydrodynamics applied to the rotating shallow-water equations, and many of the properties will remain for more general Eulerian methods. Making use of Hamiltonian normal-form theory, it has previously been shown that, if initial conditions for the system are chosen as image points of the map, then the fast components of the system have exponentially small magnitude for exponentially long times as {$\epsilon\rightarrow$}0, and this property is preserved if one uses a symplectic integrator for the numerical time stepping. The map may then be used to parametrize initial conditions near the slow manifold, allowing data assimilation to be performed without introducing any fast degrees of motion (more generally, the precise amount of fast motion can be selected).},

This paper introduces a novel gradient-based dimension reduction method in which the informed subspace does not depend on the data. This permits an online-offline computational strategy where the expensive low-dimensional structure of the problem is detected in an offline phase, meaning before observing the data. This strategy is particularly relevant for multiple inversion problems as the same informed subspace can be reused. The proposed approach allows controlling the approximation error (in expectation over the data) of the posterior distribution. We also present sampling strategies that exploit the informed subspace to draw efficiently samples from the exact posterior distribution. The method is successfully illustrated on two numerical examples: a PDE-based inverse problem with a Gaussian process prior and a tomography problem with Poisson data and a Besov-\$\textbackslash mathcal\{B\}\^2\_\{11\}\$ prior.},

  abstract = {The intrinsic dimensionality of an inverse problem is affected by prior information, the accuracy and number of observations, and the smoothing properties of the forward operator. From a Bayesian perspective, changes from the prior to the posterior may, in many problems, be confined to a relatively low-dimensional subspace of the parameter space. We present a dimension reduction approach that defines and identifies such a subspace, called the "likelihood-informed subspace" (LIS), by characterizing the relative influences of the prior and the likelihood over the support of the posterior distribution. This identification enables new and more efficient computational methods for Bayesian inference with nonlinear forward models and Gaussian priors. In particular, we approximate the posterior distribution as the product of a lower-dimensional posterior defined on the LIS and the prior distribution marginalized onto the complementary subspace. Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling can then proceed in lower dimensions, with significant gains in computational efficiency. We also introduce a Rao-Blackwellization strategy that de-randomizes Monte Carlo estimates of posterior expectations for additional variance reduction. We demonstrate the efficiency of our methods using two numerical examples: inference of permeability in a groundwater system governed by an elliptic PDE, and an atmospheric remote sensing problem based on Global Ozone Monitoring System (GOMOS) observations.},

Yet incomplete or noisy data, the state variation and parameter dependence of the forward model, and correlations in the prior collectively provide useful structure that can be exploited for dimension reduction in this setting--both in the parameter space of the inverse problem and in the state space of the forward model. To this end, we show how to jointly construct low-dimensional subspaces of the parameter space and the state space in order to accelerate the Bayesian solution of the inverse problem. As a byproduct of state dimension reduction, we also show how to identify low-dimensional subspaces of the data in problems with high-dimensional observations. These subspaces enable approximation of the posterior as a product of two factors: (i) a projection of the posterior onto a low-dimensional parameter subspace, wherein the original likelihood is replaced by an approximation involving a reduced model; and (ii) the marginal prior distribution on the high-dimensional complement of the parameter subspace. We present and compare several strategies for constructing these subspaces using only a limited number of forward and adjoint model simulations. The resulting posterior approximations can rapidly be characterized using standard sampling techniques, e.g., Markov chain Monte Carlo. Two numerical examples demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our approach: inversion of an integral equation in atmospheric remote sensing, where the data dimension is very high; and the inference of a heterogeneous transmissivity field in a groundwater system, which involves a partial differential equation forward model with high dimensional state and parameters.},

We introduce a novel class of normalizing flows, called principal manifold flows (PF), whose contours are its principal manifolds, and a variant for injective flows (iPF) that is more efficient to train than regular injective flows. PFs can be constructed using any flow architecture, are trained with a regularized maximum likelihood objective and can perform density estimation on all of their principal manifolds. In our experiments we show that PFs and iPFs are able to learn the principal manifolds over a variety of datasets. Additionally, we show that PFs can perform density estimation on data that lie on a manifold with variable dimensionality, which is not possible with existing normalizing flows.},

The proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) approach to model reduction is used to identify a reduced-order control space for a two-dimensional global shallow water model. A reduced second-order adjoint (SOA) model is developed and used to facilitate the implementation of a Hessian-free truncated-Newton (HFTN) minimization algorithm in the POD-based space. The efficiency of the SOA/HFTN implementation is analysed by comparison with the quasi-Newton BFGS and a nonlinear conjugate gradient algorithm. Several data assimilation experiments that differ only in the optimization algorithm employed are performed in the reduced control space. Numerical results indicate that first-order derivative methods are effective during the initial stages of the assimilation; in the later stages, the use of second-order derivative information is of benefit and HFTN provided significant CPU time savings when compared to the BFGS and CG algorithms. A comparison with data assimilation experiments in the full model space shows that with an appropriate selection of the basis functions the optimization in the POD space is able to provide accurate results at a reduced computational cost. The HFTN algorithm benefited most from the order reduction since computational savings were achieved both in the outer and inner iterations of the method. Further experiments are required to validate the approach for comprehensive global circulation models. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Existing methods based on implicit multiplication via automatic differentiation or Kronecker-factored block diagonal approximations do not consider noise in the mini-batch. We present VIVIT, a curvature model that leverages the GGN's low-rank structure without further approximations. It allows for efficient computation of eigenvalues, eigenvectors, as well as per-sample first- and second-order directional derivatives. The representation is computed in parallel with gradients in one backward pass and offers a fine-grained cost-accuracy trade-off, which allows it to scale. As examples for VIVIT's usefulness, we investigate the directional gradients and curvatures during training, and how noise information can be used to improve the stability of second-order methods.},

The tidal model considered is a semi-linearized one in which kinematical non-linearities are neglected but non-linear bottom friction is included. The parameters to be estimated (bottom friction coefficient and water depth) are assumed to be position-dependent and are approximated by piecewise linear interpolations between certain nodal values. The numerical scheme consists of a two-level leapfrog method. The adjoint scheme is constructed on the assumption that a certain norm of the difference between computed and observed elevations at the tide gauges should be minimized. It is shown that a satisfactory numerical minimization can be completed using either the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) quasi-Newton algorithm or Nash's truncated Newton algorithm. On the basis of a number of test problems, it is shown that very effective estimation of the nodal values of the parameters can be achieved provided the number of data stations is sufficiently large in relation to the number of nodes.},

If allowed for, more information can be extracted from observations, longer time windows are possible, and the minimisation process is easier, at least in principle. Weak constraint 4D-Var estimates the model error and minimises a series of linear least-squares cost functionsfunctions, which can be achieved using the conjugate gradient (CG) method; minimising each cost function is called an inner loop. CG needs preconditioning to improve its performance. In previous work, limited memory preconditioners (LMPs) have been constructed using approximations of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Hessian in the previous inner loop. If the Hessian changes significantly in consecutive inner loops, the LMP may be of limited usefulness. To circumvent this, we propose using randomised methods for low rank eigenvalue decomposition and use these approximations to cheaply construct LMPs using information from the current inner loop. Three randomised methods are compared. Numerical experiments in idealized systems show that the resulting LMPs perform better than the existing LMPs. Using these methods may allow more efficient and robust implementations of incremental weak constraint 4D-Var.},

An idealized application to vortex propagation on a {$\beta$} plane shows agreement between nested and high resolution solutions. A realistic application to the California Current System then confirm these results in a complex configuration. The selected algorithm is now part of ROMS\_AGRIF. It is fully consistent with ROMS parallel capabilities on both shared and distributed memory architectures. The nesting implementation authorizes several nesting levels and several grids at any particular level. This operational capability, combined with the inner qualities of our two-way nesting algorithm and generally high-order accuracy of ROMS numerics, allow for realistic simulation of coastal and ocean dynamics at multiple, interacting scales.},

Our training results for a single ion species case, with self-collisions and collision against electrons, show that the proposed stochastic augmented Lagrangian approach can achieve higher model prediction accuracy than training with a fixed penalty method for our application problem, with the accuracy high enough for practical applications in kinetic simulations.},

Many of these new data-driven methods have produced impressive results, although most only give point estimates for the reconstruction.

In our work, we apply generative flow-based models based on invertible neural networks to two challenging medical imaging tasks, i.e., low-dose computed tomography and accelerated medical resonance imaging. We test different architectures of invertible neural networks and provide extensive ablation studies. In most applications, a standard Gaussian is used as the base distribution for a flow-based model. Our results show that the choice of a radial distribution can improve the quality of reconstructions.},

In the variational data assimilation approach, applied in geophysical sciences, the dimensions of the background error covariance matrix (B) are usually too large to be explicitly determined and B needs to be modeled. Recent efforts to include new variables in the analysis such as cloud parameters and chemical species have required the development of the code to GENerate the Background Errors (GEN\_BE) version 2.0 for the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) community model. GEN\_BE allows for a simpler, flexible, robust, and community-oriented framework that gathers methods used by some meteorological operational centers and researchers. We present the advantages of this new design for the data assimilation community by performing benchmarks of different modeling of B and showing some of the new features in data assimilation test cases. As data assimilation for clouds remains a challenge, we present a multivariate approach that includes hydrometeors in the control variables and new correlated errors. In addition, the GEN\_BE v2.0 code is employed to diagnose error parameter statistics for chemical species, which shows that it is a tool flexible enough to implement new control variables. While the generation of the background errors statistics code was first developed for atmospheric research, the new version (GEN\_BE v2.0) can be easily applied to other domains of science and chosen to diagnose and model B. Initially developed for variational data assimilation, the model of the B matrix may be useful for variational ensemble hybrid methods as well.},

It is based on the idea that a good representation is one in which the data has a distribution that is easy to model. For this purpose, a non-linear deterministic transformation of the data is learned that maps it to a latent space so as to make the transformed data conform to a factorized distribution, i.e., resulting in independent latent variables. We parametrize this transformation so that computing the Jacobian determinant and inverse transform is trivial, yet we maintain the ability to learn complex non-linear transformations, via a composition of simple building blocks, each based on a deep neural network. The training criterion is simply the exact log-likelihood, which is tractable. Unbiased ancestral sampling is also easy. We show that this approach yields good generative models on four image datasets and can be used for inpainting.},

Apr\`es avoir pr\'ecis\'e diff\'erents cadres d'analyse d'identifiabilit\'e, nous nous int\'eressons plus particuli\`erement \`a l'identifiabilit\'e a posteriori, pour des conditions exp\'erimentales fix\'ees, puis \`a l'identifiabilit\'e pratique, prenant en plus en compte les bruits de mesure. Pour ce dernier cadre, nous proposons une m\'ethodologie d'analyse locale autour de valeurs particuli\`eres des param\`etres. En ce qui concerne l'identifiabilit\'e des param\`etres du mod\`ele dynamique de la phase photocytotoxique de la PDT, nous montrons que parmi les dix param\`etres localement identifiables a posteriori, seulement l'un d'entre eux l'est en pratique. N\'eanmoins, ces r\'esultats locaux demeurent insuffisants en raison des larges plages de variation possibles des param\`etres du mod\`ele et n\'ecessitent d'\^etre compl\'et\'es par une analyse globale. Le manque de m\'ethode visant \`a tester l'identifiabilit\'e globale a posteriori ou pratique, nous a orient\'es vers l'analyse de sensibilit\'e globale de la sortie du mod\`ele par rapport \`a ses param\`etres. Une m\'ethode d'analyse de sensibilit\'e globale fond\'ee sur l'\'etude de la variance a permis de mettre en \'evidence trois param\`etres sensibilisants. Nous abordons ensuite les liens entre les analyses globales d'identifiabilit\'e et de sensibilit\'e des param\`etres, en employant une d\'ecomposition de Sobol'. Nous montrons alors que les liens suivants existent : une fonction de sensibilit\'e totale nulle implique un param\`etre non-identifiable; deux fonctions de sensibilit\'e colin\'eaires impliquent la non-identifiabilit\'e mutuelle des param\`etres en question ; la non-injectivit\'e de la sortie par rapport \`a un de ses param\`etres peut aussi entrainer la non-identifiabilit\'e du param\`etre en question mais ce dernier point ne peut \^etre d\'etect\'e en analysant les fonctions de sensibilit\'e uniquement. En somme, la d\'etection des param\`etres non globalement identifiables dans un cadre exp\'erimental donn\'e \`a partir de r\'esultats d'analyse de sensibilit\'e globale ne peut \^etre que partielle.

Two cases are considered: i) insensitive (or non-observable) parameters ; ii) two (or more) correlated sensitivity measures of the model output with respect to model parameters.

This study shows how it is possible to apply SVAR in practice by reducing the computational effort required by the algorithm. A major finding of the study is that, instead of using tangent linear and adjoint models, it is possible to estimate the largest eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors of the evolution of the background error covariances only by applying successive nonlinear model integrations. Another major finding is that the impact of future observations on previous state estimates may be obtained in an accurate and numerically stable way by using suitably defined cost functions and control space transformations without any additional model integrations. The new method is applied in a realistic data assimilation experiment with a primitive equations ocean model.},

  abstract = {Particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (pMCMC) is now a popular method for performing Bayesian statistical inference on challenging state space models (SSMs) with unknown static parameters. It uses a particle filter (PF) at each iteration of an MCMC algorithm to unbiasedly estimate the likelihood for a given static parameter value. However, pMCMC can be computationally intensive when a large number of particles in the PF is required, such as when the data is highly informative, the model is misspecified and/or the time series is long. In this paper we exploit the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) developed in the data assimilation literature to speed up pMCMC. We replace the unbiased PF likelihood with the biased EnKF likelihood estimate within MCMC to sample over the space of the static parameter. On a wide class of different non-linear SSM models, we demonstrate that our new ensemble MCMC (eMCMC) method can significantly reduce the computational cost whilst maintaining reasonable accuracy. We also propose several extensions of the vanilla eMCMC algorithm to further improve computational efficiency.

Starting with the premise that simulation-based approaches are not affordable for such problems, and that the most-probablefailure-point-based approaches do not permit to quantify the error on the estimation of the failure probability, an approach based on both metamodels and advanced simulation techniques is explored. The kriging metamodeling technique is chosen in order to surrogate the performance functions because it allows one to genuinely quantify the surrogate error. The surrogate error onto the limit-state surfaces is propagated to the failure probabilities estimates in order to provide an empirical error measure. This error is then sequentially reduced by means of a populationbased adaptive refinement technique until the kriging surrogates are accurate enough for reliability analysis. This original refinement strategy makes it possible to add several observations in the design of experiments at the same time. Reliability and reliability sensitivity analyses are performed by means of the subset simulation technique for the sake of numerical efficiency. The adaptive surrogate-based strategy for reliability estimation is finally involved into a classical gradient-based optimization algorithm in order to solve the RBDO problem. The kriging surrogates are built in a so-called augmented reliability space thus making them reusable from one nested RBDO iteration to the other. The strategy is compared to other approaches available in the literature on three academic examples in the field of structural mechanics.},

Cross validation is often used for testing ``moving neighborhood'' kriging models; in this case, each unknown value is predicted from a small number of surrounding data. In ``unique neighborhood'' kriging algorithms, each estimation uses all the available data; as a result, cross validation would spend much computer time. For instance, with ndata points it would cost at least the resolution of nsystems of n \texttimes{} nlinear equations (each with a different matrix).Here, we present a much faster method for cross validation in a unique neighborhood. Instead of solving nsystems n \texttimes{} n,it only requires the inversion of one n \texttimes{} nmatrix. We also generalized this method to leaving out several points instead of one.},

Our interest is in the reconstruction of piecewise continuous fields in which the discontinuity set is described by a finite number of geometric parameters. Natural applications include groundwater flow and electrical impedance tomography. We take a Bayesian approach, placing a prior distribution on \$u\$ and determining the conditional distribution on \$u\$ given the data \$y\$. It is then natural to study maximum a posterior (MAP) estimators. Recently (Dashti et al 2013) it has been shown that MAP estimators can be characterised as minimisers of a generalised Onsager-Machlup functional, in the case where the prior measure is a Gaussian random field. We extend this theory to a more general class of prior distributions which allows for piecewise continuous fields. Specifically, the prior field is assumed to be piecewise Gaussian with random interfaces between the different Gaussians defined by a finite number of parameters. We also make connections with recent work on MAP estimators for linear problems and possibly non-Gaussian priors (Helin, Burger 2015) which employs the notion of Fomin derivative. In showing applicability of our theory we focus on the groundwater flow and EIT models, though the theory holds more generally. Numerical experiments are implemented for the groundwater flow model, demonstrating the feasibility of determining MAP estimators for these piecewise continuous models, but also that the geometric formulation can lead to multiple nearby (local) MAP estimators. We relate these MAP estimators to the behaviour of output from MCMC samples of the posterior, obtained using a state-of-the-art function space Metropolis-Hastings method.},

The approach is non-intrusive and makes use of discrete sampling based on collocation on simplex elements in stochastic space. Adjoint or dual equations are introduced to estimate errors in statistical moments of random functionals resulting from the inexact reconstruction of the solution within the simplex elements. The approach is demonstrated to be accurate in estimating errors in statistical moments of interest and shown to exhibit super-convergence, in accordance with the underlying theoretical rates. Goal-oriented error indicators are then built using the adjoint solution and exploited to identify regions for adaptive sampling. The error-estimation and adaptive refinement strategy is applied to a range of problems including those governed by algebraic equations as well as scalar and systems of ordinary and partial differential equations. The strategy holds promise as a reliable method to set and achieve error tolerances for efficient aleatory uncertainty quantification in complex problems. Furthermore, the procedure can be combined with numerical error estimates in physical space so as to effectively manage a computational budget to achieve the best possible overall accuracy in the results.}

It has recently been shown that Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can predict the performance of a shape quickly and accurately and be used to optimize more effectively than traditional techniques that rely on response-surfaces obtained by Kriging. However, GNNs suffer from the fact that they do not evaluate their own accuracy, which is something Bayesian Optimization methods require. Therefore, estimating confidence in generated predictions is necessary to go beyond straight deterministic optimization, which is less effective. In this paper, we demonstrate that we can use Ensembles-based technique to overcome this limitation and outperform the state-of-the-art. Our experiments on diverse aerodynamics and structural analysis tasks prove that adding uncertainty to shape optimization significantly improves the quality of resulting shapes and reduces the time required for the optimization.},

These algorithms are based on the theory and calculations of second-order subdifferentials of nonsmooth functions with employing the machinery of second-order variational analysis and generalized differentiation. First we develop a globally superlinearly convergent damped Newton-type algorithm for the class of continuously differentiable functions with Lipschitzian gradients, which are nonsmooth of second order. Then we design such a globally convergent algorithm to solve a structured class of nonsmooth quadratic composite problems with extended-real-valued cost functions, which typically arise in machine learning and statistics. Finally, we present the results of numerical experiments and compare the performance of our main algorithm applied to an important class of Lasso problems with those achieved by other first-order and second-order optimization algorithms},

  abstract = {An important challenge in structural reliability is to keep to a minimum the number of calls to the numerical models. Engineering problems involve more and more complex computer codes and the evaluation of the probability of failure may require very time-consuming computations. Metamodels are used to reduce these computation times. To assess reliability, the most popular approach remains the numerous variants of response surfaces. Polynomial Chaos [1] and Support Vector Machine [2] are also possibilities and have gained considerations among researchers in the last decades. However, recently, Kriging, originated from geostatistics, have emerged in reliability analysis. Widespread in optimisation, Kriging has just started to appear in uncertainty propagation [3] and reliability [4], [5] studies. It presents interesting characteristics such as exact interpolation and a local index of uncertainty on the prediction which can be used in active learning methods. The aim of this paper is to propose an iterative approach based on Monte Carlo Simulation and Kriging metamodel to assess the reliability of structures in a more efficient way. The method is called AK-MCS for Active learning reliability method combining Kriging and Monte Carlo Simulation. It is shown to be very efficient as the probability of failure obtained with AK-MCS is very accurate and this, for only a small number of calls to the performance function. Several examples from literature are performed to illustrate the methodology and to prove its efficiency particularly for problems dealing with high non-linearity, non-differentiability, non-convex and non-connex domains of failure and high dimensionality.},

A new estimator defined as a minimiser of the {$\Psi$}-divergence functional based on data is suggested and is shown to be a robustified maximum likelihood estimator under some simple conditions on the {$\Psi$}. When {$\Psi$} is an identity function, the {$\Psi$}-divergence reduces to the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the new estimator reduces to the usual maximum likelihood estimator. The "{$\Psi$}-likelihood" is defined, and minimization of the {$\Psi$}-divergence is shown to be equivalent to maximization of the {$\Psi$}-likelihood. Once a probability model and a generic function are chosen, one can automatically construct such a robustified estimator. Several informative examples are provided, and relationships with existing robust estimation methods are discussed.},

Ce mod\`ele r\'eduit remplace le mod\`ele direct afin de r\'eduire le co\^ut de calcul li\'e aux m\'ethodes ensemblistes en quantification d'incertitudes et assimilation de donn\'ees. Le contexte de l'\'etude est la pr\'evision des crues et la gestion de la ressource en eau. Ce manuscrit est compos\'e de cinq parties, chacune divis\'ee en chapitres. La premi\`ere partie pr\'esente un \'etat de l'art des travaux en quantification des incertitudes et en assimilation de donn\'ees dans le domaine de l'hydraulique ainsi que les objectifs de la th\`ese. On pr\'esente le cadre de la pr\'evision des crues, ses enjeux et les outils dont on dispose pour pr\'evoir la dynamique des rivi\`eres. On pr\'esente notamment la future mission SWOT qui a pour but de mesurer les hauteurs d'eau dans les rivi\`eres avec un couverture globale \`a haute r\'esolution. On pr\'ecise notamment l'apport de ces mesures et leur compl\'ementarit\'e avec les mesures in-situ. La deuxi\`eme partie pr\'esente les \'equations de Saint-Venant, qui d\'ecrivent les \'ecoulements dans les rivi\`eres, ainsi qu'une discr\'etisation num\'erique de ces \'equations, telle qu'impl\'ement\'ee dans le logiciel Mascaret-1D. Le dernier chapitre de cette partie propose des simplifications des \'equations de Saint-Venant. La troisi\`eme partie de ce manuscrit pr\'esente les m\'ethodes de quantification et de r\'eduction des incertitudes. On pr\'esente notamment le contexte probabiliste de la quantification d'incertitudes et d'analyse de sensibilit\'e. On propose ensuite de r\'eduire la dimension d'un probl\`eme stochastique quand on traite de champs al\'eatoires. Les m\'ethodes de d\'ecomposition en polyn\^omes du chaos sont ensuite pr\'esent\'ees. Cette partie d\'edi\'ee \`a la m\'ethodologie s'ach\`eve par un chapitre consacr\'e \`a l'assimilation de donn\'ees ensemblistes et \`a l'utilisation des mod\`eles r\'eduits dans ce cadre. La quatri\`eme partie de ce manuscrit est d\'edi\'ee aux r\'esultats. On commence par identifier les sources d'incertitudes en hydraulique que l'on s'attache \`a quantifier et r\'eduire par la suite. Un article en cours de r\'evision d\'etaille la validation d'un mod\`ele r\'eduit pour les \'equations de Saint-Venant en r\'egime stationnaire lorsque l'incertitude est majoritairement port\'ee par les coefficients de frottement et le d\'ebit \`a l'amont. On montre que les moments statistiques, la densit\'e de probabilit\'e et la matrice de covariances spatiales pour la hauteur d'eau sont efficacement et pr\'ecis\'ement estim\'es \`a l'aide du mod\`ele r\'eduit dont la construction ne n\'ecessite que quelques dizaines d'int\'egrations du mod\`ele direct. On met \`a profit l'utilisation du mod\`ele r\'eduit pour r\'eduire le co\^ut de calcul du filtre de Kalman d'Ensemble dans le cadre d'un exercice d'assimilation de donn\'ees synth\'etiques de type SWOT. On s'int\'eresse pr\'ecis\'ement \`a la repr\'esentation spatiale de la donn\'ee telle que vue par SWOT: couverture globale du r\'eseau, moyennage spatial entre les pixels observ\'es. On montre notamment qu'\`a budget de calcul donn\'e les r\'esultats de l'analyse d'assimilation de donn\'ees qui repose sur l'utilisation du mod\`ele r\'eduit sont meilleurs que ceux obtenus avec le filtre classique. On s'int\'eresse enfin \`a la construction du mod\`ele r\'eduit en r\'egime instationnaire. On suppose ici que l'incertitude est li\'ee aux coefficients de frottement. Il s'agit \`a pr\'esent de juger de la n\'ecessit\'e du recalcul des coefficients polynomiaux au fil du temps et des cycles d'assimilation de donn\'ees. Pour ce travail seul des donn\'ees in-situ ont \'et\'e consid\'er\'ees. On suppose dans un deuxi\`eme temps que l'incertitude est port\'ee par le d\'ebit en amont du r\'eseau, qui est un vecteur temporel. On proc\`ede \`a une d\'ecomposition de type Karhunen-Lo\`eve pour r\'eduire la taille de l'espace incertain aux trois premiers modes. Nous sommes ainsi en mesure de mener \`a bien un exercice d'assimilation de donn\'ees. Pour finir, les conclusions et les perspectives de ce travail sont pr\'esent\'ees en cinqui\`eme partie.},

In addition to the direct nesting of uncertainty quantification within optimization, formulations are presented for surrogate-based optimization under uncertainty in which the surrogate model appears at the optimization level, at the uncertainty quantification level, or at both levels. These surrogate models encompass both data fit and hierarchical surrogates. The DAKOTA software framework is used to provide the foundation for prototyping and initial benchmarking of these formulations. A critical component is the extension of algorithmic techniques for deterministic surrogate-based optimization to these surrogate-based optimization under uncertainty formulations. This involves the use of sequential trust regionbased approaches to manage the extent of the approximations and verify the approximate optima. Two analytic test problems and one engineering problem are solved using the different methodologies in order to compare their relative merits. Results show that surrogate-based optimization under uncertainty formulations show promise both in reducing the number of function evaluations required and in mitigating the effects of nonsmooth response variations.},

Such data-driven models, however, typically ignore physical insights from the scientific system under consideration. Among other things, a ``physics-informed'' model formulation should encode some degree of stability or robustness or well-conditioning (in that a small change of the input will not lead to drastic changes in the output), characteristic of the underlying scientific problem. We investigate whether it is possible to include physics-informed prior knowledge for improving the model quality (e.g., generalization performance, sensitivity to parameter tuning, or robustness in the presence of noisy data). To that extent, we focus on the stability of an equilibrium, one of the most basic properties a dynamic system can have, via the lens of Lyapunov analysis. For the prototypical problem of fluid flow prediction, we show that models preserving Lyapunov stability improve the generalization error and reduce the prediction uncertainty.},

Certainly the words ``statistical evidence,'' or perhaps just ``evidence,'' are much used in statistical contexts. It is fair to say, however, that the precise characterization of this concept is somewhat elusive. Our goal here is to provide a definition of how to measure statistical evidence for any particular statistical problem. Since evidence is what causes beliefs to change, it is proposed to measure evidence by the amount beliefs change from a priori to a posteriori. As such, our definition involves prior beliefs and this raises issues of subjectivity versus objectivity in statistical analyses. This is dealt with through a principle requiring the falsifiability of any ingredients to a statistical analysis. These concerns lead to checking for prior-data conflict and measuring the a priori bias in a prior.},

  abstract = {Designing appropriate variational regularization schemes is a crucial part of solving inverse problems, making them better-posed and guaranteeing that the solution of the associated optimization problem satisfies desirable properties. Recently, learning-based strategies have appeared to be very efficient for solving inverse problems, by learning direct inversion schemes or plug-and-play regularizers from available pairs of true states and observations. In this paper, we go a step further and design an end-to-end framework allowing to learn actual variational frameworks for inverse problems in such a supervised setting. The variational cost and the gradient-based solver are both stated as neural networks using automatic differentiation for the latter. We can jointly learn both components to minimize the data reconstruction error on the true states. This leads to a data-driven discovery of variational models. We consider an application to inverse problems with incomplete datasets (image inpainting and multivariate time series interpolation). We experimentally illustrate that this framework can lead to a significant gain in terms of reconstruction performance, including w.r.t. the direct minimization of the variational formulation derived from the known generative model.},

Here, we investigate how physics-informed deep learning may provide new means to revisit data assimilation problems. We develop a so-called end-to-end learning approach, which explicitly relies on a variational data assimilation formulation. Using automatic differentiation embedded in deep learning framework, the key novelty of the proposed physics-informed approach is to allow the joint training of the representation of the dynamical process of interest as well as of the solver of the data assimilation problem. We may perform this joint training using both supervised and unsupervised strategies. Our numerical experiments on Lorenz-63 and Lorenz-96 systems report significant gain w.r.t. a classic gradient-based minimization of the variational cost both in terms of reconstruction performance and optimization complexity. Intriguingly, we also show that the variational models issued from the true Lorenz-63 and Lorenz-96 ODE representations may not lead to the best reconstruction performance. We believe these results may open new research avenues for the specification of assimilation models for earth systems, both to speed-up the inversion problem with trainable solvers but possibly more importantly in the way data assimilation systems are designed, for instance regarding the representation of geophysical dynamics.},

Both the objective and constraint functions are assumed to be smooth, non-linear and expensive to evaluate. As a consequence, the number of evaluations that can be used to carry out the optimization is very limited, as in complex industrial design optimization problems. The method we propose to overcome this difficulty has its roots in both the Bayesian and the multi-objective optimization literatures. More specifically, an extended domination rule is used to handle objectives and constraints in a unified way, and a corresponding expected hyper-volume improvement sampling criterion is proposed. This new criterion is naturally adapted to the search of a feasible point when none is available, and reduces to existing Bayesian sampling criteria---the classical Expected Improvement (EI) criterion and some of its constrained/multi-objective extensions---as soon as at least one feasible point is available. The calculation and optimization of the criterion are performed using Sequential Monte Carlo techniques. In particular, an algorithm similar to the subset simulation method, which is well known in the field of structural reliability, is used to estimate the criterion. The method, which we call BMOO (for Bayesian Multi-Objective Optimization), is compared to state-of-the-art algorithms for single- and multi-objective constrained optimization.},

  abstract = {Ensemble variational methods are being increasingly used in the field of geophysical data assimilation. Their efficiency comes from the combined use of ensembles, which provide statistics estimates, and a variational analysis, which handles nonlinear operators through iterative optimization techniques. Taking model error into account in four-dimensional ensemble variational algorithms is challenging because the state trajectory over the data assimilation window (DAW) is no longer determined by its sole initial condition. In particular, the control variable dimension scales with the DAW length, which yields a high numerical complexity. This is unfortunate since accuracy improvement is expected with longer DAWs. Building upon the work of [P. Sakov and M. Bocquet, Tellus A, 70 (2018), 1414545], this paper discusses how to algorithmically construct and numerically test an iterative ensemble Kalman smoother with additive model error (IEnKS-Q) which is thought to be the natural weak constraint generalization of the IEnKS [M. Bocquet and P. Sakov, Quart. J. Roy. Meteorol. Soc., 140 (2014), pp. 1521--1535], as well as the generalization of IEnKF-Q [P. Sakov, J. Haussaire, and M. Bocquet, Quart. J. Roy. Meteorol. Soc., 144 (2018), pp. 1297--1309] to general DAWs. The number of model evaluations per cycle of the IEnKS-Q is also examined. Solutions based on perturbation decomposition are proposed to dissociate those numerically costly evaluations from the control variable dimension.},

This makes medoid shift considerably faster than mean shift, contrarily to what previously believed. We then exploit kernel methods to extend both mean shift and the improved medoid shift to a large family of distances, with complexity bounded by the effective rank of the resulting kernel matrix, and with explicit regularization constraints. Finally, we show that, under certain conditions, medoid shift fails to cluster data points belonging to the same mode, resulting in over-fragmentation. We propose remedies for this problem, by introducing a novel, simple and extremely efficient clustering algorithm, called quick shift, that explicitly trades off under- and overfragmentation. Like medoid shift, quick shift operates in non-Euclidean spaces in a straightforward manner. We also show that the accelerated medoid shift can be used to initialize mean shift for increased efficiency. We illustrate our algorithms to clustering data on manifolds, image segmentation, and the automatic discovery of visual categories.},

Despite the widespread application of BMA in the literature, there were not many accounts of these differences and trends besides a few landmark revisions in the late 1990s and early 2000s, therefore not taking into account any advancements made in the last 15 years.

We also develop a conceptual classification scheme to better describe this vast literature, understand its trends and future directions and provide guidance for the researcher interested in both the application and development of the methodology.

  abstract = {Efficiently approximating local curvature information of the loss function is a key tool for optimization and compression of deep neural networks. Yet, most existing methods to approximate second-order information have high computational or storage costs, which limits their practicality. In this work, we investigate matrix-free, linear-time approaches for estimating Inverse-Hessian Vector Products (IHVPs) for the case when the Hessian can be approximated as a sum of rank-one matrices, as in the classic approximation of the Hessian by the empirical Fisher matrix. We propose two new algorithms: the first is tailored towards network compression and can compute the IHVP for dimension d, if the Hessian is given as a sum of m rank-one matrices, using O(dm2) precomputation, O(dm) cost for computing the IHVP, and query cost O(m) for any single element of the inverse Hessian. The second algorithm targets an optimization setting, where we wish to compute the product between the inverse Hessian, estimated over a sliding window of optimization steps, and a given gradient direction, as required for preconditioned SGD. We give an algorithm with cost O(dm + m2) for computing the IHVP and O(dm + m3) for adding or removing any gradient from the sliding window. These two algorithms yield state-of-the-art results for network pruning and optimization with lower computational overhead relative to existing second-order methods. Implementations are available at [9] and [17].},

The physical model can subsequently be evolved into the future to make predictions. This principle is a cornerstone of large scale forecasting applications such as numerical weather prediction. As such, it is implemented in current operational systems of weather forecasting agencies across the globe. However, finding a good initial state poses a difficult optimization problem in part due to the non-invertible relationship between physical states and their corresponding observations. We learn a mapping from observational data to physical states and show how it can be used to improve optimizability. We employ this mapping in two ways: to better initialize the non-convex optimization problem, and to reformulate the objective function in better behaved physics space instead of observation space. Our experimental results for the Lorenz96 model and a two-dimensional turbulent fluid flow demonstrate that this procedure significantly improves forecast quality for chaotic systems.},

Despite its importance, the degree to which an observation operator influences the performance of data assimilation methods is still poorly understood. This study aimed to analyze the influences of linear and nonlinear observation operators on the sequential data assimilation through soil temperature simulation using the unscented particle filter (UPF) and the common land model. The linear observation operator between unprocessed simulations and observations was first established. To improve the correlation between simulations and observations, both were processed based on a series of equations. This processing essentially resulted in a nonlinear observation operator. The linear and nonlinear observation operators were then used along with the UPF in three assimilation experiments: an hourly in situ soil surface temperature assimilation, a daily in situ soil surface temperature assimilation, and a moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature (LST) assimilation. The results show that the filter improved the soil temperature simulation significantly with the linear and nonlinear observation operators. The nonlinear observation operator improved the UPF's performance more significantly for the hourly and daily in situ observation assimilations than the linear observation operator did, while the situation was opposite for the MODIS LST assimilation. Because of the high assimilation frequency and data quality, the simulation accuracy was significantly improved in all soil layers for hourly in situ soil surface temperature assimilation, while the significant improvements of the simulation accuracy were limited to the lower soil layers for the assimilation experiments with low assimilation frequency or low data quality.},

In recent years kriging has emerged as a widely applied metamodeling technique for resource-intensive computational experiments. However its prediction quality is highly dependent on the size and distribution of the given training points. Hence, in order to build proficient kriging models with as few samples as possible adaptive sampling strategies have gained considerable attention. These techniques aim to find pertinent points in an iterative manner based on information extracted from the current metamodel. A review of adaptive schemes for kriging proposed in the literature is presented in this article. The objective is to provide the reader with an overview of the main principles of adaptive techniques, and insightful details to pertinently employ available tools depending on the application at hand. In this context commonly applied strategies are compared with regards to their characteristics and approximation capabilities. In light of these experiments, it is found that the success of a scheme depends on the features of a specific problem and the goal of the analysis. In order to facilitate the entry into adaptive sampling a guide is provided. All experiments described herein are replicable using a provided open source toolbox.},

Given a regression or classification problem in which we wish to predict a response variable Y from an explanatory variable X, we treat the problem of dimensionality reduction as that of finding a low-dimensional ``effective subspace'' for X which retains the statistical relationship between X and Y . We show that this problem can be formulated in terms of conditional independence. To turn this formulation into an optimization problem we establish a general nonparametric characterization of conditional independence using covariance operators on reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. This characterization allows us to derive a contrast function for estimation of the effective subspace. Unlike many conventional methods for dimensionality reduction in supervised learning, the proposed method requires neither assumptions on the marginal distribution of X, nor a parametric model of the conditional distribution of Y . We present experiments that compare the performance of the method with conventional methods.},

It seeks to give a representative picture of the research topics most explored in recent years, highlight common themes in the investigations of independent research teams and highlight the contributions of rising as well as established researchers both to the theory of robust optimization and its practice. With respect to the theory of robust optimization, this paper reviews recent results on the cases without and with recourse, i.e., the static and dynamic settings, as well as the connection with stochastic optimization and risk theory, the concept of distributionally robust optimization, and findings in robust nonlinear optimization. With respect to the practice of robust optimization, we consider a broad spectrum of applications, in particular inventory and logistics, finance, revenue management, but also queueing networks, machine learning, energy systems and the public good. Key developments in the period from 2007 to present include: (i) an extensive body of work on robust decision-making under uncertainty with uncertain distributions, i.e., ``robustifying'' stochastic optimization, (ii) a greater connection with decision sciences by linking uncertainty sets to risk theory, (iii) further results on nonlinear optimization and sequential decision-making and (iv) besides more work on established families of examples such as robust inventory and revenue management, the addition to the robust optimization literature of new application areas, especially energy systems and the public good.},

  abstract = {Large-scale linear systems coming from suitable discretizations of linear inverse problems are challenging to solve. Indeed, since they are inherently ill-posed, appropriate regularization should be applied; since they are large-scale, well-established direct regularization methods (such as Tikhonov regularization) cannot often be straightforwardly employed, and iterative linear solvers should be exploited. Moreover, every regularization method crucially depends on the choice of one or more regularization parameters, which should be suitably tuned. The aim of this paper is twofold: (a) survey some well-established regularizing projection methods based on Krylov subspace methods (with a particular emphasis on methods based on the Golub-Kahan bidiagonalization algorithm), and the so-called hybrid approaches (which combine Tikhonov regularization and projection onto Krylov subspaces of increasing dimension); (b) introduce a new principled and adaptive algorithmic approach for regularization similar to specific instances of hybrid methods. In particular, the new strategy provides reliable parameter choice rules by leveraging the framework of bilevel optimization, and the links between Gauss quadrature and Golub-Kahan bidiagonalization. Numerical tests modeling inverse problems in imaging illustrate the performance of existing regularizing Krylov methods, and validate the new algorithms.},

The formulation builds on a finite-volume model with a Godunov-type scheme for its shock capturing capabilities. Orthogonal polynomials from the Askey scheme provide expansion of the variables in terms of a finite number of modes from which the mean and higher-order moments of the distribution can be derived. The orthogonal property of the polynomials allows the use of a Galerkin projection to derive separate equations for the individual modes. Implementation of the polynomial chaos expansion and its nonintrusive counterpart determines the modal contributions from the resulting system of equations. Examples of long-wave transformation over a submerged hump illustrate the stochastic approach with uncertainties represented by Gaussian distribution. Additional results demonstrate the applicability of the approach with other distributions as well. The stochastic solution agrees well with the results from the Monte Carlo method, but at a small fraction of its computing cost.},

  abstract = {Many phenomena are modeled by deterministic differential equations , whereas the observation of these phenomena, in particular in life sciences, exhibits an important variability. This paper addresses the following question: how can the model be adapted to reflect the observed variability? Given an adequate model, it is possible to account for this variability by allowing some parameters to adopt a stochastic behavior. Finding the parameters probability density function that explains the observed variability is a difficult stochastic inverse problem, especially when the computational cost of the forward problem is high. In this paper, a non-parametric and non-intrusive procedure based on offline computations of the forward model is proposed. It infers the probability density function of the uncertain parameters from the matching of the statistical moments of observable degrees of freedom (DOFs) of the model. This inverse procedure is improved by incorporating an algorithm that selects a subset of the model DOFs that both reduces its computational cost and increases its robustness. This algorithm uses the pre-computed model outputs to build an approximation of the local sensitivities. The DOFs are selected so that the maximum information on the sensitivities is conserved. The proposed approach is illustrated with elliptic and parabolic PDEs. In the Appendix, an nonlinear ODE is considered and the strategy is compared with two existing ones.},

In this paper, an efficient replication-based strategy is proposed to estimate the full set of first- and second-order Sobol' indices. It relies on a Sobol' pick-freeze estimation scheme and requires only two replicated designs based on randomized orthogonal arrays of strength two. The precision of this procedure is assessed with bootstrap confidence intervals, presented for the first time in the replication framework. Our developments are compared to known approaches and validated on numerical test cases. A way to estimate the full set of first-, second-order but also total-effect Sobol' indices at a very competitive cost is also described, as a combination of our procedure and the one introduced by Saltelli.},

Many deterministic global optimization algorithms used in the field of computer experiments are based on Kriging (Gaussian process regression). Starting with a spatial predictor including a measure of uncertainty, they proceed by iteratively choosing the point maximizing a criterion which is a compromise between predicted performance and uncertainty. Distributing the evaluation of such numerically expensive objective functions on many processors is an appealing idea. Here we investigate a multi-points optimization criterion, the multipoints expected improvement ({$\mathsl{q}-\mathbb{E}\mathsl{I}$}q-EIq-\{\textbackslash mathbb E\}I), aimed at choosing several points at the same time. An analytical expression of the {$\mathsl{q}-\mathbb{E}\mathsl{I}$}q-EIq-\{\textbackslash mathbb E\}I is given when q\,=\,2, and a consistent statistical estimate is given for the general case. We then propose two classes of heuristic strategies meant to approximately optimize the {$\mathsl{q}-\mathbb{E}\mathsl{I}$}q-EIq-\{\textbackslash mathbb E\}I, and apply them to the classical Branin-Hoo test-case function. It is finally demonstrated within the covered example that the latter strategies perform as good as the best Latin Hypercubes and Uniform Designs ever found by simulation (2000 designs drawn at random for every q\,{$\in$} [1,10]).},

These algorithms rely on the iterative maximization of sampling criteria such as the Expected Improvement (EI), which takes advantage of Kriging conditional distributions to make an explicit trade-off between promising and uncertain points in the search space. We have recently worked on a multipoint EI criterion meant to choose simultaneously several points for synchronous parallel computation. The results presented in this article concern sequential procedures with a fixed number of iterations. We show that maximizing the usual EI at each iteration is suboptimal. In essence, the latter amounts to considering the current iteration as the last one. This work formulates the problem of optimal strategy for finite horizon sequential optimization, provides the solution to this problem in terms of a new multipoint EI, and illustrates the suboptimality of maximizing the 1-point EI at each iteration on the basis of a first counter-example.},

  abstract = {Typically, point forecasting methods are compared and assessed by means of an error measure or scoring function, such as the absolute error or the squared error. The individual scores are then averaged over forecast cases, to result in a summary measure of the predictive performance, such as the mean absolute error or the (root) mean squared error. I demonstrate that this common practice can lead to grossly misguided inferences, unless the scoring function and the forecasting task are carefully matched. Effective point forecasting requires that the scoring function be specified ex ante, or that the forecaster receives a directive in the form of a statistical functional, such as the mean or a quantile of the predictive distribution. If the scoring function is specified ex ante, the forecaster can issue the optimal point forecast, namely, the Bayes rule. If the forecaster receives a directive in the form of a functional, it is critical that the scoring function be consistent for it, in the sense that the expected score is minimized when following the directive. A functional is elicitable if there exists a scoring function that is strictly consistent for it. Expectations, ratios of expectations and quantiles are elicitable. For example, a scoring function is consistent for the mean functional if and only if it is a Bregman function. It is consistent for a quantile if and only if it is generalized piecewise linear. Similar characterizations apply to ratios of expectations and to expectiles. Weighted scoring functions are consistent for functionals that adapt to the weighting in peculiar ways. Not all functionals are elicitable; for instance, conditional value-at-risk is not, despite its popularity in quantitative finance.},

Probabilistic forecasting aims to maximize the sharpness of the predictive distributions, subject to calibration, on the basis of the available information set.

Proper scoring rules such as the logarithmic score and the continuous ranked probability score serve to assess calibration and sharpness simultaneously. As a special case, consistent scoring functions provide decision-theoretically coherent tools for evaluating point forecasts. We emphasize methodological links to parametric and nonparametric distributional regression techniques, which attempt to model and to estimate conditional distribution functions; we use the context of statistically postprocessed ensemble forecasts in numerical weather prediction as an example.

Traditional approaches such as MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) are prohibitive to be applied to large complex dynamic models because of the high computational cost of computing resources. To reduce the number of model evaluations required, we proposed an adaptive surrogate modeling-based sampling strategy for parameter distribution estimation, named ASMO-PODE (Adaptive Surrogate Modeling-based Optimization \textendash{} Parameter Optimization and Distribution Estimation). The ASMO-PODE can provide an estimation of the parameter distribution using as little as one percent of the model evaluations required by a regular MCMC approach.

  abstract = {Parameter specification usually has significant influence on the performance of land surface models (LSMs). However, estimating the parameters properly is a challenging task due to the following reasons: (1) LSMs usually have too many adjustable parameters (20 to 100 or even more), leading to the curse of dimensionality in the parameter input space; (2) LSMs usually have many output variables involving water/energy/carbon cycles, so that calibrating LSMs is actually a multi-objective optimization problem; (3) Regional LSMs are expensive to run, while conventional multi-objective optimization methods need a large number of model runs (typically {$\sim$} 105\textendash 106). It makes parameter optimization computationally prohibitive. An uncertainty quantification framework was developed to meet the aforementioned challenges, which include the following steps: (1) using parameter screening to reduce the number of adjustable parameters, (2) using surrogate models to emulate the responses of dynamic models to the variation of adjustable parameters, (3) using an adaptive strategy to improve the efficiency of surrogate modeling-based optimization; (4) using a weighting function to transfer multi-objective optimization to single-objective optimization. In this study, we demonstrate the uncertainty quantification framework on a single column application of a LSM \textendash{} the Common Land Model (CoLM), and evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework. The result indicate that this framework can efficiently achieve optimal parameters in a more effective way.

In this paper, a multiobjective adaptive surrogate modeling?based optimization (MO?ASMO) algorithm is introduced that aims to reduce computational cost while maintaining optimization effectiveness. Geophysical dynamic models usually have a prior parameterization scheme derived from the physical processes involved, and our goal is to improve all of the objectives by parameter calibration. In this study, we developed a method for directing the search processes toward the region that can improve all of the objectives simultaneously. We tested the MO?ASMO algorithm against NSGA?II and SUMO with 13 test functions and a land surface model ? the Common Land Model (CoLM).

It is particularly well suited to the treatment of very large scale variational data assimilation problems that arise in atmosphere and ocean forecasting. The procedure consists of a sequence of linear least squares approximations to the nonlinear problem, each of which is solved by an ``inner'' direct or iterative process. In comparison with Newton's method and its variants, the algorithm is attractive because it does not require the evaluation of second-order derivatives in the Hessian of the objective function. In practice the exact Gauss\textendash Newton method is too expensive to apply operationally in meteorological forecasting, and various approximations are made in order to reduce computational costs and to solve the problems in real time. Here we investigate the effects on the convergence of the Gauss\textendash Newton method of two types of approximation used commonly in data assimilation. First, we examine ``truncated'' Gauss\textendash Newton methods where the inner linear least squares problem is not solved exactly, and second, we examine ``perturbed'' Gauss\textendash Newton methods where the true linearized inner problem is approximated by a simplified, or perturbed, linear least squares problem. We give conditions ensuring that the truncated and perturbed Gauss\textendash Newton methods converge and also derive rates of convergence for the iterations. The results are illustrated by a simple numerical example. A practical application to the problem of data assimilation in a typical meteorological system is presented.},

  abstract = {Data assimilation is a concept involving any method which estimates the initial state of a dynamical system by combining both the information from a numerical model and from observations. The computed estimated initial state of the system can then be integrated in time to obtain a forecast. There are two main ways to solve data assimilation problems. The sequential methods are based on statistical estimation theory and regroup the different Kalman filtering approaches. The variational methods are based on optimal control theory and state nonlinear weighted least-squares problems as the four-dimensional variational (4D-Var) formulation. Approximations of these methods have been defined to make them suitable for solving large-scale data assimilation problems. In the first part of this paper, we present a theoretical work on the equivalence between the Kalman filter and the 4D-Var, that we then generalize to the approximate case, for the SEEK filter and the reduced 4D-Var. We next concentrate on the solution of the 4D-Var which is usually computed with a Gauss-Newton algorithm using a preconditioned conjugate-gradient-like (CG) method. Motivated by the equivalences shown in the first part, we explore in a second part the techniques used in the SEEK filter, which are based on relevant information contained in the empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs), as an attempt to further accelerate the Gauss-Newton method. This leads to the development of an appropriate starting point for the CG method together with that of a powerful limited memory preconditioner (LMP), as shown by preliminary numerical experiments performed on a shallow water model.},

In the single-criterion case, robust optimization methodology helps to identify solutions which remain feasible and of good quality for all possible scenarios. A well-known alternative method in the single-objective case is to compare possible decisions under uncertainty with the optimal decision with the benefit of hindsight, i.e. to minimize the (possibly scaled) regret of not having chosen the optimal decision. In this contribution, we extend the concept of regret from the single-objective case to the multiobjective setting and introduce a proper definition of multivariate (robust) (relative) regret. In contrast to the few existing ideas that mix scalarization and optimization, we clearly separate the modelling of multiobjective (robust) regret from its numerical solution. Moreover, our approach is not limited to a finite uncertainty set or interval uncertainty and furthermore, computations or at least approximations remain tractable in several important special cases. We illustrate all approaches based on a biobjective shortest path problem under uncertainty.},

The resulting analog methods using analogs from a catalog (AnEnOI), and using constructed analogs (cAnEnOI), are tested in the context of a multiscale Lorenz-`96 model, with standard EnOI and an ensemble square root filter for comparison. The use of analogs from a modestly-sized catalog is shown to improve the performance of EnOI, with limited marginal improvements resulting from increases in the catalog size. The method using constructed analogs (cAnEnOI) is found to perform as well as a full ensemble square root filter, and to be robust over a wide range of tuning parameters.},

A particular technique that has emerged as a promising alternative to the time-consuming Monte-Carlo method for such analyses, is the polynomial chaos expansion (PCE). However, PCE-based methods suffer from a rapid increase in their computational cost with the number of random variables included in the analysis. This paper demonstrates that a hybrid Monte-Carlo/PCE technique can lead to the dramatic acceleration of its constituent methods, in the context of FDTD, effectively mitigating the ``curse of dimensionality'' and facilitating the multi-parametric uncertainty analysis of electromagnetic geometries.},

The new estimator requires only a few matrix-vector multiplications and can be applied when the matrix is not known explicitly. It is useful for efficiently estimating the sensitivity of vector-valued functions and can be applied to many problems where the power method runs into difficulties. Lower bounds for the probability that an estimate is within a given factor of the correct norm are derived. These bounds are straightforward to compute and show that a very inaccurate estimate is extremely unlikely in most cases. A conservative lower bound has been derived and a tighter bound is given in the form of a conjecture. This conjecture is true in some important special cases and the general case is supported by considerable empirical evidence.},

  abstract = {Flexible hierarchical Bayesian modeling of massive data is challenging due to poorly scaling computations in large sample size settings. This article is motivated by spatial process models for analyzing geostatistical data, which typically entail computations that become prohibitive as the number of spatial locations becomes large. We propose a three-step divide-and-conquer strategy within the Bayesian paradigm to achieve massive scalability for any spatial process model. We partition the data into a large number of subsets, apply a readily available Bayesian spatial process model on every subset in parallel, and optimally combine the posterior distributions estimated across all the subsets into a pseudo-posterior distribution that conditions on the entire data. The combined pseudo posterior distribution is used for predicting the responses at arbitrary locations and for performing posterior inference on the model parameters and the residual spatial surface. We call this approach "Distributed Kriging" (DISK). It offers significant advantages in applications where the entire data are or can be stored on multiple machines. Under the standard theoretical setup, we show that if the number of subsets is not too large, then the Bayes risk of estimating the true residual spatial surface using the DISK posterior distribution decays to zero at a nearly optimal rate. While DISK is a general approach to distributed nonparametric regression, we focus on its applications in spatial statistics and demonstrate its empirical performance using a stationary full-rank and a nonstationary low-rank model based on Gaussian process (GP) prior. A variety of simulations and a geostatistical analysis of the Pacific Ocean sea surface temperature data validate our theoretical results.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with the derivation of a probabilistic parametric model from interval or fuzzy data using the maximum likelihood principle. In contrast with classical techniques such as the EM algorithm, that define a precise likelihood function by averaging inside each imprecise observations, our approach presupposes that each imprecise observation underlies a precise one, and that the uncertainty that pervades its observation is epistemic, rather than representing noise. We define an interval-valued likelihood function and apply robust optimisation methods to find a safe plausible estimate of the statistical parameters. The resulting density has a standard deviation that is large enough to cover the imprecision of the observations, making a pessimistic assumption on dispersion. This approach is extended to fuzzy data by optimizing the average of lower likelihoods over a collection of data sets obtained from cuts of the fuzzy intervals, as a trade off between optimistic and pessimistic interpretations of fuzzy data. The principles of this method are compared with those of other existing approaches to handle incompleteness of observations, especially the EM technique.},

In the Pareto method, there is a dominated solution and a non-dominated solution obtained by a continuously updated algorithm. Meanwhile, the scalarization method creates multi-objective functions made into a single solution using weights. There are three types of weights in scalarization which are equal weights, rank order centroid weights, and rank-sum weights. Next, the solution using the Pareto method is a performance indicators component that forms MOO a separate and produces a compromise solution and can be displayed in the form of Pareto optimal front, while the solution using the scalarization method is a performance indicators component that forms a scalar function which is incorporated in the fitness function.},

  abstract = {Numerical weather prediction (NWP) centres use numerical models of the atmospheric flow to forecast future weather states from an estimate of the current state. Variational data assimilation (VAR) is used commonly to determine an optimal state estimate that miminizes the errors between observations of the dynamical system and model predictions of the flow. The rate of convergence of the VAR scheme and the sensitivity of the solution to errors are dependent on the condition number of the Hessian of the variational least-squares objective function. The traditional formulation of VAR is illconditioned and hence leads to slow convergence and an inaccurate solution. In practice, operational NWP centres precondition the system via a control variable transform to reduce the condition number of the Hessian. In this paper we investigate the conditioning of VAR for a single, periodic, spatiallydistributed state variable. We present theoretical bounds on the condition number of the original and preconditioned Hessians and hence establish the improvement produced by the preconditioning. We also investigate theoretically the effect of observation position and error variance on the preconditioned system and show that the problem becomes more ill-conditioned with increasingly dense and accurate observations. Finally, we confirm the theoretical results in an operational setting by giving experimental results from the Met Office variational system.},

By interfacing with the JAX library, Veros is able to run high-performance simulations on both CPU and GPU through the same code base, with full support for distributed architectures. On CPU, Veros is able to match the performance of a Fortran reference, both on a single process and on hundreds of CPU cores. On GPU, we find that each device can replace dozens to hundreds of CPU cores, at a fraction of the energy consumption. We demonstrate the viability of using GPUs for earth system modelling by integrating a global 0.1{$\smwhtcircle$} eddy-resolving setup in single precision, where we achieve 1.3 model years per day on a single compute instance with 16 GPUs, comparable to over 2000 Fortran processes.},

In this paper, a notion of comparative likelihood when uncertainty is represented by a weighted set of probability measures is defined.

However, using reduced-precision in 4D-Var data assimilation is relatively unexplored and there are potential issues with using single-precision in the tangent-linear and adjoint models. Here, we present the results of reducing numerical precision in an incremental 4D-Var data assimilation scheme, with an underlying two-layer quasigeostrophic model. The minimizer used is the conjugate gradient method. We show how reducing precision increases the asymmetry between the tangent-linear and adjoint models. For ill-conditioned problems, this leads to a loss of orthogonality among the residuals of the conjugate gradient algorithm, which slows the convergence of the minimization procedure. However, we also show that a standard technique, reorthogonalization, eliminates these issues and therefore could allow the use of single-precision arithmetic. This work is carried out within ECMWF's data assimilation framework, the Object Oriented Prediction System.},

At each iteration, PES selects the next evaluation point that maximizes the expected information gained with respect to the global maximum. PES codifies this intractable acquisition function in terms of the expected reduction in the differential entropy of the predictive distribution. This reformulation allows PES to obtain approximations that are both more accurate and efficient than other alternatives such as Entropy Search (ES). Furthermore, PES can easily perform a fully Bayesian treatment of the model hyperparameters while ES cannot. We evaluate PES in both synthetic and realworld applications, including optimization problems in machine learning, finance, biotechnology, and robotics. We show that the increased accuracy of PES leads to significant gains in optimization performance.},

  abstract = {Interactions between meteorological and hydrodynamic processes are poorly understood, and may result in large uncertainties when assessing the performance of sea defences in extreme conditions. This study integrates numerical weather prediction models with models of wave generation and propagation, and surge and tide propagation. By using an ensemble methodology, the uncertainty at each stage of the model cascade may be quantified. Subsequently, this information, either as a proxy or appropriately transformed into predictive uncertainty, will be valuable in calculating the likelihood of hydraulic and structural failure in extreme storms. This paper describes results for a domain centred on one of the locations for the proposed Severn Barrage. This barrage will be the focus for the world's largest marine renewable energy scheme and will potentially have a significant impact on the coastal flooding response of this part of the Severn Estuary. Dynamically downscaled, high resolution wind and pressure fields of historic extreme storms are generated using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) modelling system. The state of the art tide and surge model, POLCOMS, in conjunction with a third generation wave model (ProWAM), utilises the meteorological data, producing hydrodynamic parameters such as surge and wave heights at a proposed location for the Severn Barrage. European Centre for Medium range Forecasting (ECMWF) Ensemble Prediction System data are used for boundary conditions in WRF, producing a 50-member ensemble. The variation in storm track and intensity between members allows the uncertainty in the model system to be quantified in terms of wave and surge heights. This work is part of the NERC funded EPIRUS consortium research but is closely allied to the interests of the EPSRC FRMRC project and the HEPEX international network focused on ensemble prediction in the context of hydrological prediction systems.},

Many deterministic global optimization algorithms used in the field of computer experiments are based on Kriging (Gaussian process regression). Starting with a spatial predictor including a measure of uncertainty, they proceed by iteratively choosing the point maximizing a criterion which is a compromise between predicted performance and uncertainty. Distributing the evaluation of such numerically expensive objective functions on many processors is an appealing idea. Here we investigate a multi-points optimization criterion, the multipoints expected improvement (q-EI), aimed at choosing several points at the same time. An analytical expression of the q-EI is given when q = 2, and a consistent statistical estimate is given for the general case. We then propose two classes of heuristic strategies meant to approximately optimize the q-EI, and apply them to the classical Branin-Hoo test-case function. It is finally demonstrated within the covered example that the latter strategies perform as good as the best Latin Hypercubes and Uniform Designs ever found by simulation (2000 designs drawn at random for every q {$\in$} [1, 10]).},

  abstract = {Accurately representing coastal and shelf seas in global ocean models represents one of the grand challenges of Earth system science. They are regions of immense societal importance through the goods and services they provide, hazards they pose and their role in global-scale processes and cycles, e.g. carbon fluxes and dense water formation. However, they are poorly represented in the current generation of global ocean models. In this contribution, we aim to briefly characterise the problem, and then to identify the important physical processes, and their scales, needed to address this issue in the context of the options available to resolve these scales globally and the evolving computational landscape. We find barotropic and topographic scales are well resolved by the current state-of-the-art model resolutions, e.g. nominal 1/12\textdegree, and still reasonably well resolved at 1/4\textdegree; here, the focus is on process representation. We identify tides, vertical coordinates, river inflows and mixing schemes as four areas where modelling approaches can readily be transferred from regional to global modelling with substantial benefit. In terms of finer-scale processes, we find that a 1/12\textdegree{} global model resolves the first baroclinic Rossby radius for only {$\sim$} 8 \% of regions {$<$} 500 m deep, but this increases to {$\sim$} 70 \% for a 1/72\textdegree{} model, so resolving scales globally requires substantially finer resolution than the current state of the art. We quantify the benefit of improved resolution and process representation using 1/12\textdegree{} global- and basin-scale northern North Atlantic nucleus for a European model of the ocean (NEMO) simulations; the latter includes tides and a k-{$\epsilon$} vertical mixing scheme. These are compared with global stratification observations and 19 models from CMIP5. In terms of correlation and basin-wide rms error, the high-resolution models outperform all these CMIP5 models. The model with tides shows improved seasonal cycles compared to the high-resolution model without tides. The benefits of resolution are particularly apparent in eastern boundary upwelling zones. To explore the balance between the size of a globally refined model and that of multiscale modelling options (e.g. finite element, finite volume or a two-way nesting approach), we consider a simple scale analysis and a conceptual grid refining approach. We put this analysis in the context of evolving computer systems, discussing model turnaround time, scalability and resource costs. Using a simple cost model compared to a reference configuration (taken to be a 1/4\textdegree{} global model in 2011) and the increasing performance of the UK Research Councils' computer facility, we estimate an unstructured mesh multiscale approach, resolving process scales down to 1.5 km, would use a comparable share of the computer resource by 2021, the two-way nested multiscale approach by 2022, and a 1/72\textdegree{} global model by 2026. However, we also note that a 1/12\textdegree{} global model would not have a comparable computational cost to a 1\textdegree{} global model in 2017 until 2027. Hence, we conclude that for computationally expensive models (e.g. for oceanographic research or operational oceanography), resolving scales to {$\sim$} 1.5 km would be routinely practical in about a decade given substantial effort on numerical and computational development. For complex Earth system models, this extends to about 2 decades, suggesting the focus here needs to be on improved process parameterisation to meet these challenges.},

  abstract = {The robust design of horizontal axis wind turbines, including both parameter design and tolerance design, is presented. A simple way of designing robust horizontal axis wind turbine systems under realistic conditions is outlined with multiple design parameters (variables), multiple objectives, and multiple constraints simultaneously by using the traditional Taguchi method and its extensions. The performance of the turbines is predicted using the axial momentum theory and the blade element momentum theory. In the parameter design stage, the energy output of the turbine is maximized using the Taguchi method and an extended penalty-based Taguchi method is proposed to solve constrained parameter design problems. The results of the unconstrained and constrained parameter design problems, in terms of the objective function and constraints are compared. Using an appropriate set of tolerance settings of the parameters, the tolerance design problem is formulated so as to yield an economical design, while ensuring a minimal variability in the performance of the wind turbine. The resulting multi-objective tolerance design problem is solved using the traditional Taguchi method. The present work provides a simple and economical approach for the robust optimal design of horizontal axis wind turbines.}

In this review article, we give an A to Z exposition of the power prior and its applications to date. We review its theoretical properties, variations in its formulation, statistical contexts for which it has been used, applications, and its advantages over other informative priors. We review models for which it has been used, including generalized linear models, survival models, and random effects models. Statistical areas where the power prior has been used include model selection, experimental design, hierarchical modeling, and conjugate priors. Prequentist properties of power priors in posterior inference are established and a simulation study is conducted to further examine the empirical performance of the posterior estimates with power priors. Real data analyses are given illustrating the power prior as well as the use of the power prior in the Bayesian design of clinical trials.},

This problem can be modeled as a two-persons zero-sum game between an Engineer and Nature. The Engineer controls a subset of the variables (nodes in the graph), and tries to assign their values to maximize an objective function. Nature controls the complementary subset of variables and tries to minimize the same objective. This setting encompasses estimation and optimization problems under model uncertainty, and strategic problems with a graph structure. Von Neumann's minimax theorem guarantees the existence of a (minimax) pair of randomized strategies that provide optimal robustness for each player against its adversary. We prove several structural properties of this strategy pair in the case of graph-structured payoff function. In particular, the randomized minimax strategies (distributions over variable assignments) can be chosen in such a way to satisfy the Markov property with respect to the graph. This significantly reduces the problem dimensionality. Finally we introduce a message passing algorithm to solve this minimax problem. The algorithm generalizes max-product belief propagation to this new domain.},

  abstract = {Finding the optimal (lightest, least expensive, etc.) design for an engineered component that meets or exceeds a specified level of reliability is a problem of obvious interest across a wide spectrum of engineering fields. Various methods for this reliability-based design optimization problem have been proposed. Unfortunately, this problem is rarely solved in practice because, regardless of the method used, solving the problem is too expensive or the final solution is too inaccurate to ensure that the reliability constraint is actually satisfied. This is especially true for engineering applications involving expensive, implicit, and possibly nonlinear performance functions (such as large finite element models). The Efficient Global Reliability Analysis method was recently introduced to improve both the accuracy and efficiency of reliability analysis for this type of performance function. This paper explores how this new reliability analysis method can be used in a design optimization context to create a method of sufficient accuracy and efficiency to enable the use of reliability-based design optimization as a practical design tool.}

This is supported empirically by the difficulty of recovering images from their hidden representations, in most commonly used network architectures. In this paper we show via a one-to-one mapping that this loss of information is not a necessary condition to learn representations that generalize well on complicated problems, such as ImageNet. Via a cascade of homeomorphic layers, we build the i-RevNet, a network that can be fully inverted up to the final projection onto the classes, i.e. no information is discarded. Building an invertible architecture is difficult, for one, because the local inversion is ill-conditioned, we overcome this by providing an explicit inverse. An analysis of i-RevNets learned representations suggests an alternative explanation for the success of deep networks by a progressive contraction and linear separation with depth. To shed light on the nature of the model learned by the i-RevNet we reconstruct linear interpolations between natural image representations.},

MEU requires computation of expected utility and its optimization over the decision variable. In portfolio problems, the expected utility is generally not analytically available. Traditional methods resort to gradient-based estimates of expected utility with its ensuing derivatives. This leads to computational inefficiencies which are particularly acute in portfolio problems with parameter uncertainty (a.k.a. estimation risk). Our simulation-based method avoids the calculation of derivative and also allows for functional optimization. The algorithm combines Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) with the insights of simulated annealing and evolutionary Monte Carlo. It can exploit conjugate utility functions and latent variables in the relevant predictive density for efficient simulation. We also show how slice sampling naturally allows for constraints in the portfolio weights. We illustrate our methodology with a portfolio problem with estimation risk and CARA utility.},

  year = {2010},

  abstract = {Robust analysis and optimization is typically based on repeated calls to a deterministic simulator that aim at propagating uncertainties and finding optimal design variables. Without loss of generality a double set of simulation parameters can be assumed: x are deterministic optimization variables, u are random parameters of known probability density function and f (x, u) is the objective function attached to the simulator. Most robust optimization methods involve two imbricated tasks, the u's uncertainty propagation (e.g., Monte Carlo simulations, reliability index calculation) which is recurcively performed inside optimization iterations on the x's. In practice, f is often calculated through a computationally expensive software. This makes the computational cost one of the principal obstacle to optimization in the presence of uncertainties. This report proposes a new efficient method for minimizing the mean objective function, min E[f(x, U)]. The efficiency stems from the simultaneous sampling of f for uncertainty propagation and optimization, i.e., the hierarchical imbrication is avoided. Y(x,u) ({$\omega$}), a kriging (Gaussian process conditioned on t past calculations of f) model of f (x, u) is built and the mean process, Z(x) ({$\omega$}) = E[Y(x,U)({$\omega$})], is analytically derived from it. The sampling criterion that yields both x and u is the one-step ahead minimum variance of the mean process Z at the maximizer of the expected improvement. The method is compared with Monte Carlo and kriging-based approaches on analytical test functions in two, four and six dimensions.},

A completely new direction will be considered here to study BVS with a Gibbs posterior originating in statistical mechanics. The Gibbs posterior is constructed from a risk function of practical interest (such as the classification error) and aims at minimizing a risk function without modeling the data probabilistically. This can improve the performance over the usual Bayesian approach, which depends on a probability model which may be misspecified. Conditions will be provided to achieve good risk performance, even in the presence of high dimensionality, when the number of candidate variables "\$K\$" can be much larger than the sample size "\$n\$." In addition, we develop a convenient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to implement BVS with the Gibbs posterior.},

  abstract = {We consider kernel-type methods for estimation of a density on [0, 1] which eschew explicit boundary correction. Our starting point is the successful implementation of beta kernel density estimators of Chen (1999). We propose and investigate two alternatives. For the first, we reverse the roles of estimation point x and datapoint Xi in each summand of the estimator. For the second, we provide kernels that are symmetric in x and X; these kernels are conditional densities of bivariate copulas. We develop asymptotic theory for the new estimators and compare them with Chen's in a substantial simulation study. We also develop automatic bandwidth selection in the form of `rule-of-thumb' bandwidths for all three estimators. We find that our second proposal, that based on `copula kernels', seems particularly competitive with the beta kernel method of Chen in integrated squared error performance terms. Advantages include its greater range of possible values at 0 and 1, the fact that it is a bona fide density, and that the individual kernels and resulting estimator are comprehensible in terms of a direct single picture (as is ordinary kernel density estimation on the line).},

This algorithm relies on the factorization \$X=YY\^T\$, where the number of columns of Y fixes an upper bound on the rank of the positive semidefinite matrix X. It is thus very effective for solving problems that have a low-rank solution. The factorization \$X=YY\^T\$ leads to a reformulation of the original problem as an optimization on a particular quotient manifold. The present paper discusses the geometry of that manifold and derives a second-order optimization method with guaranteed quadratic convergence. It furthermore provides some conditions on the rank of the factorization to ensure equivalence with the original problem. In contrast to existing methods, the proposed algorithm converges monotonically to the sought solution. Its numerical efficiency is evaluated on two applications: the maximal cut of a graph and the problem of sparse principal component analysis.},

In this paper, we present a new robustness approach, called lexicographic {$\alpha$}-robustness, which compensates for the drawbacks of criteria based on the worst case. We apply this approach to the 1-median location problem under uncertainty on node weights and we give a specific algorithm to determine robust solutions in the case of a tree.

  abstract = {The phase retrieval problem, where one aims to recover a complex-valued image from far-field intensity measurements, is a classic problem encountered in a range of imaging applications. Modern phase retrieval approaches usually rely on gradient descent methods in a nonlinear minimization framework. Calculating closed-form gradients for use in these methods is tedious work, and formulating second order derivatives is even more laborious. Additionally, second order techniques often require the storage and inversion of large matrices of partial derivatives, with memory requirements that can be prohibitive for data-rich imaging modalities. We use a reverse-mode automatic differentiation (AD) framework to implement an efficient matrix-free version of the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm, a longstanding method that finds popular use in nonlinear least-square minimization problems but which has seen little use in phase retrieval. Furthermore, we extend the basic LM algorithm so that it can be applied for more general constrained optimization problems (including phase retrieval problems) beyond just the least-square applications. Since we use AD, we only need to specify the physics-based forward model for a specific imaging application; the first and second-order derivative terms are calculated automatically through matrix-vector products, without explicitly forming the large Jacobian or Gauss-Newton matrices typically required for the LM method. We demonstrate that this algorithm can be used to solve both the unconstrained ptychographic object retrieval problem and the constrained ``blind'' ptychographic object and probe retrieval problems, under the popular Gaussian noise model as well as the Poisson noise model. We compare this algorithm to state-of-the-art first order ptychographic reconstruction methods to demonstrate empirically that this method outperforms best-in-class first-order methods: it provides excellent convergence guarantees with (in many cases) a superlinear rate of convergence, all with a computational cost comparable to, or lower than, the tested first-order algorithms.},

  abstract = {In a 1935 paper, and in his book Theory of Probability, Jeffreys developed a methodology for quantifying the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. The centerpiece was a number, now called the Bayes factor, which is the posterior odds of the null hypothesis when the prior probability on the null is one-half. Although there has been much discussion of Bayesian hypothesis testing in the context of criticism of P-values, less attention has been given to the Bayes factor as a practical tool of applied statistics. In this paper we review and discuss the uses of Bayes factors in the context of five scientific applications. The points we emphasize are:- from Jeffreys's Bayesian point of view, the purpose of hypothesis testing is to evaluate the evidence in favor of a scientific theory;- Bayes factors offer a way of evaluating evidence in favor ofa null hypothesis;- Bayes factors provide a way of incorporating external information into the evaluation of evidence about a hypothesis;- Bayes factors are very general, and do not require alternative models to be nested;- several techniques are available for computing Bayes factors, including asymptotic approximations which are easy to compute using the output from standard packages that maximize likelihoods;- in "non-standard " statistical models that do not satisfy common regularity conditions, it can be technically simpler to calculate Bayes factors than to derive non-Bayesian significance},

Such models, implemented as computer codes, are often generic in the sense that by a suitable choice of some of the model's input parameters the code can be used to predict the behaviour of the system in a variety of specific applications. However, in any specific application the values of necessary parameters may be unknown. In this case, physical observations of the system in the specific context are used to learn about the unknown parameters. The process of fitting the model to the observed data by adjusting the parameters is known as calibration. Calibration is typically effected by ad hoc fitting, and after calibration the model is used, with the fitted input values, to predict the future behaviour of the system. We present a Bayesian calibration technique which improves on this traditional approach in two respects. First, the predictions allow for all sources of uncertainty, including the remaining uncertainty over the fitted parameters. Second, they attempt to correct for any inadequacy of the model which is revealed by a discrepancy between the observed data and the model predictions from even the best-fitting parameter values. The method is illustrated by using data from a nuclear radiation release at Tomsk, and from a more complex simulated nuclear accident exercise.},

In this paper, a different approach is adopted, and proper orthogonal decomposition is considered. The modes extracted from the decomposition may serve two purposes, namely order reduction by projecting high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space and feature extraction by revealing relevant but unexpected structure hidden in the data. The utility of the method for dynamic characterization and order reduction of linear and nonlinear mechanical systems is demonstrated in this study.},

Here, we can tractably calculate the normalization constant and draw posterior i.i.d. samples. Remarkably, our Bayesian tractability criterion is simply log concavity of the prior and likelihood: the same criterion for tractable calculation of the maximum a posteriori point estimate.

The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods.

Uncertainties are characterized as epistemic, if the modeler sees a possibility to reduce them by gathering more data or by refining models. Uncertainties are categorized as aleatory if the modeler does not foresee the possibility of reducing them. From a pragmatic standpoint, it is useful to thus categorize the uncertainties within a model, since it then becomes clear as to which uncertainties have the potential of being reduced. More importantly, epistemic uncertainties may introduce dependence among random events, which may not be properly noted if the character of uncertainties is not correctly modeled. Influences of the two types of uncertainties in reliability assessment, codified design, performance-based engineering and risk-based decision-making are discussed. Two simple examples demonstrate the influence of statistical dependence arising from epistemic uncertainties on systems and time-variant reliability problems.},

The proposed generators progressively increase dimension from a low-dimensional latent space. We demonstrate that TRUMPETs can be trained orders of magnitudes faster than standard flows while yielding samples of comparable or better quality. They retain many of the advantages of the standard flows such as training based on maximum likelihood and a fast, exact inverse of the generator. Since TRUMPETs are injective and have fast inverses, they can be effectively used for downstream Bayesian inference. To wit, we use TRUMPET priors for maximum a posteriori estimation in the context of image reconstruction from compressive measurements, outperforming competitive baselines in terms of reconstruction quality and speed. We then propose an efficient method for posterior characterization and uncertainty quantification with TRUMPETs by taking advantage of the low-dimensional latent space.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a hierarchical, multi-resolution framework for the identification of model parameters and their spatially variability from noisy measurements of the response or output. Such parameters are frequently encountered in PDE-based models and correspond to quantities such as density or pressure fields, elasto-plastic moduli and internal variables in solid mechanics, conductivity fields in heat diffusion problems, permeability fields in fluid flow through porous media etc. The proposed model has all the advantages of traditional Bayesian formulations such as the ability to produce measures of confidence for the inferences made and providing not only predictive estimates but also quantitative measures of the predictive uncertainty. In contrast to existing approaches it utilizes a parsimonious, non-parametric formulation that favors sparse representations and whose complexity can be determined from the data. The proposed framework in non-intrusive and makes use of a sequence of forward solvers operating at various resolutions. As a result, inexpensive, coarse solvers are used to identify the most salient features of the unknown field(s) which are subsequently enriched by invoking solvers operating at finer resolutions. This leads to significant computational savings particularly in problems involving computationally demanding forward models but also improvements in accuracy. It is based on a novel, adaptive scheme based on Sequential Monte Carlo sampling which is embarrassingly parallelizable and circumvents issues with slow mixing encountered in Markov Chain Monte Carlo schemes.},

Robustness of the layout, in cases of demand uncertainty, is more important for the manufacturing manager. A robust layout is one that is close to the optimal solution for a wide variety of demand scenarios even though it may not be optimal under any specific demand scenario. In this paper, we develop algorithms to generate robust layout designs for manufacturing systems. Our robustness approach to the layout decision making can be applied to single and multiple period problems in the presence of considerable uncertainty, both in terms of products to be produced as well as their production volumes. Our algorithms, executed in a heuristic fashion, can be effectively used for layout design of large size manufacturing systems.},

(doi:10.1017/S0022112010006191)), which consider quasi-steady flow in a channel completely spanned by tidal turbines, a similar channel but retaining the inertial term, and a circular turbine farm in laterally unconfined flow. We find that bottom friction uncertainty acts to increase estimates of expected power in a fully spanned channel, but generally has the reverse effect in laterally unconfined farms. The optimal number of turbines, accounting for bottom friction uncertainty, is lower for a fully spanned channel and higher in laterally unconfined farms. We estimate the typical magnitude of bottom friction uncertainty, which suggests that the effect on estimates of expected power lies in the range -5 to +30\%, but is probably small for deep channels such as the Pentland Firth (5\textendash 10\%). In such a channel, the uncertainty in power estimates due to bottom friction uncertainty remains considerable, and we estimate a relative standard deviation of 30\%, increasing to 50\% for small channels.},

The present paper considers the role of bottom friction uncertainty in a realistic numerical model of the Pentland Firth spanned by different fence configurations. We find that uncertainty in removable power estimates resulting from bed roughness uncertainty depends on the case considered, with relative uncertainty between 2\% (for a fully spanned channel with small values of mean roughness and input uncertainty) and 44\% (for an asymmetrically confined channel with high values of bed roughness and input uncertainty). Relative uncertainty in power estimates is generally smaller than (input) relative uncertainty in bottom friction by a factor of between 0.2 and 0.7, except for low turbine deployments and very high mean values of friction. This paper makes a start at quantifying uncertainty in tidal stream power estimates, and motivates further work for proper characterization of the resource, accounting for uncertainty inherent in resource modelling.},

Hydrologic knowledge is typically embodied in a deterministic catchment model. Fundamentals are presented of a Bayesian forecasting system (BFS) for producing a probabilistic forecast of a hydrologic predictand via any deterministic catchment model. The BFS decomposes the total uncertainty into input uncertainty and hydrologic uncertainty, which are quantified independently and then integrated into a predictive (Bayes) distribution. This distribution results from a revision of a prior (climatic) distribution, is well calibrated, and has a nonnegative ex ante economic value. The BFS is compared with Monte Carlo simulation and ``ensemble forecasting'' technique, none of which can alone produce a probabilistic forecast that meets requirements of rational decision making, but each can serve as a component of the BFS.},

  abstract = {Catchments that do not behave in the way the hydrologist expects, expose the frailties of hydrological science, particularly its unduly simplistic treatment of input and model uncertainty. A conceptual rainfall\textendash runoff model represents a highly simplified hypothesis of the transformation of rainfall into runoff. Sub-grid variability and mis-specification of processes introduce an irreducible model error, about which little is currently known. In addition, hydrological observation systems are far from perfect, with the principal catchment forcing (rainfall) often subject to large sampling errors. When ignored or treated simplistically, these errors develop into monsters that destroy our ability to model certain catchments. In this paper, these monsters are tackled using Bayesian Total Error Analysis, a framework that accounts for user-specified sources of error and yields quantitative insights into how prior knowledge of these uncertainties affects our ability to infer models and use them for predictive purposes. A case study involving a catchment with an apparent water balance anomaly (a hydrological monstrosity!) illustrates these concepts. It is found that, in the absence of additional information, the rainfall\textendash runoff record is insufficient to explain this anomaly \textendash{} it could be due to a large export of groundwater, systematic overestimation of catchment rainfall of the order of 40\%, or a conspiracy of these factors. There is ``no free lunch'' in hydrology. The rainfall\textendash runoff record on its own is insufficient to decompose the different sources of uncertainty affecting calibration, testing and prediction, and hydrological monstrosities will persist until additional independent knowledge of uncertainties is obtained.

  abstract = {In the present paper, the results of ongoing work within the FP7 project UMRIDA are presented and discussed. The main idea of this work is to combine the non-intrusive polynomial chaos based uncertainty quantification methods with the gradient based methods for stochastic optimization. When introducing uncertainties in a design process, the objective is no longer deterministic and can be characterized by its mean and its variance, i.e. in a robust design the optimization becomes multiobjective. Gradient based optimization of the mean objective and of the variance of the objective therefore requires the gradient of both quantities. The gradient of the mean objective is combined with the gradient of its variance using weights. By changing the weights, the Pareto front (if any, i.e. if the 2 objectives are conflicting) or at least part of it can be recovered. The proposed method is applied to the optimal shape design of the transonic RAE2822 airfoil under uncertainties. In the current work, the flight conditions (the Mach number and the angle of attack) are considered as uniformly distributed uncertain parameters. The objectives considered are the mean drag coefficient and its standard deviation. In this work, the adjoint solver and the CFD solver of SU2 (an open source CFD solver) are coupled with the polynomial chaos methods for the optimal shape design of a transonic airfoil. Hicks-Henne functions are employed to parameterize the airfoil and to represent a new geometry in the design process. The optimization procedure is performed using the sequential least square programming (SLSQP) algorithm. Two optimal designs are obtained by considering two different points on the Pareto front.},

We dispute this argument by showing that the empirical Fisher---unlike the Fisher---does not generally capture second-order information.

Bayesian optimization (BO) is a popular way to tackle optimization problems with expensive objective function evaluations, but has mostly been applied to unconstrained problems. Several BO approaches have been proposed to address expensive constraints but are limited to greedy strategies maximizing immediate reward. To address this limitation, we propose a lookahead approach that selects the next evaluation in order to maximize the long-term feasible reduction of the objective function. We present numerical experiments demonstrating the performance improvements of such a lookahead approach compared to several greedy BO algorithms, including constrained expected improvement (EIC) and predictive entropy search with constraint (PESC).},

This is especially true in high dimensional problems, where most existing algorithms cannot easily move from one mode to another. To address this issue, we propose a novel Bayesian inference approach based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo. Our method can effectively sample from multimodal distributions, especially when the dimension is high and the modes are isolated. To this end, it exploits and modifies the Riemannian geometric properties of the target distribution to create \textbackslash emph\{wormholes\} connecting modes in order to facilitate moving between them. Further, our proposed method uses the regeneration technique in order to adapt the algorithm by identifying new modes and updating the network of wormholes without affecting the stationary distribution. To find new modes, as opposed to rediscovering those previously identified, we employ a novel mode searching algorithm that explores a \textbackslash emph\{residual energy\} function obtained by subtracting an approximate Gaussian mixture density (based on previously discovered modes) from the target density function.},

Function gradients are a common auxiliary information and are useful for predicting functions with locally changing behaviors. This article is a review of the main metamodels that use function gradients in addition to function values. The goal of the article is to give the reader both an overview of the principles involved in gradientenhanced metamodels while also providing insightful formulations. The following metamodels have gradient-enhanced versions in the literature and are reviewed here: classical, weighted and moving least squares, Shepard weighting functions, and the kernel-based methods that are radial basis functions, kriging and support vector machines. The methods are set in a common framework of linear combinations between a priori chosen functions and coefficients that depend on the observations. The characteristics common to all kernel-based approaches are underlined. A new {$\nu$}-GSVR metamodel which uses gradients is given. Numerical comparisons of the metamodels are carried out for approximating analytical test functions. The experiments are replicable, as they are performed with an opensource available toolbox. The results indicate that there is a trade-off between the better computing time of least squares methods and the larger versatility of kernelbased approaches.},

This requires realistic estuarine modelling in this area strongly forced by tides and river discharge. As none of the existing models for this region would fit the actual needs of the project, a specific new generation model has been implemented. The model is based on the hydrodynamic finite element model T-UGOm. In a first step, we limit our investigations to tidal dynamics. As the Amazon estuary is a very shallow macro-tidal area, it is necessary to improve the available bathymetries and to develop a precise bottom friction parametrisation. In this paper, we discuss the implementation of a high resolution regional model. This allows us to develop a precise and accurate tidal model: for instance, the overall root mean square error on complex differences is reduced from 54cm in a standard model to 27cm in our best model. Such precise and accurate tidal modelling is a prerequisite for modelling particle transport.},

  abstract = {A la fronti\`ere entre les continents et les oc\'eans, les marges continentales sont le si\`ege de la grande majorit\'e des apports de mati\`ere - dissoutes et solides, organiques et inorganiques - d'origine continentale vers l'oc\'ean. Elles sont aussi directement en contact avec les masses d'eau oc\'eaniques qui \'echangent de la mati\`ere et des \'el\'ements avec ces marges. L'\'erosion et le transport par les rivi\`eres \'etant une des sources essentielles des \'el\'ements chimiques \`a l'oc\'ean, la remise en suspension de mat\'eriel s\'ediment\'e et les forts m\'elanges d'eau favorisent les transferts de mati\`ere du continent vers l'oc\'ean. Le projet Amandes a pour objectif l'\'etude de ces \'echanges entre continents et oc\'eans, en \'etudiant le cas particulier du transport d'\'el\'ements en provenance des montagnes andines vers l'oc\'ean Atlantique par le syst\`eme amazonien. Trois disciplines compl\'ementaires \textendash{} g\'eochimie continentale et marine, oc\'eanographie physique et mod\'elisation hydrodynamique (incluant l'assimilation de donn\'ees) \textendash{} sont associ\'ees pour atteindre ces objectifs.  Parmi les mod\`eles de la zone existants, aucun ne r\'epond aux besoins du projet Amandes. Cette th\`ese a consist\'e \`a \'etablir un nouveau mod\`ele, qui permettra d'explorer en profondeur le probl\`eme du transport,c'est-\`a-dire le d\'eplacement de toute la colonne d'eau et ce qu'elle contient, par exemple des s\'ediments. Cependant, \'etablir un nouveau mod\`ele hydrodynamique dans le but d'\'etudier le transport de mat\'eriaux par le fleuve Amazone dans l'oc\'ean Atlantique \'etait un sujet trop ambitieux pour une seule th\`ese. En cons\'equence, nous nous sommes attach\'es \`a \'etablir les bases d'un mod\`ele qui sera \'etendu par la suite. Pour r\'epondre \`a ses besoins de mod\'elisation, le projet Amandes a opt\'e pour le mod\`ele \`a grilles non-structur\'ees T-UGOm. L'avantage des grilles non-structur\'ees est leur grande souplesse, qui leur permet de s'adapter finement aux sp\'ecificit\'es g\'eographiques de la zone mod\'elis\'ee. Dans le cas de l'estuaire de l'Amazone, o\`u la g\'eographie peut \^etre complexe, cette particularit\'e est un avantage critique. Pour appliquer T-UGOm au cas de l'Amazone, il a fallu pr\'eciser certains sch\'emas num\'eriques. \'Egalement, l'estuaire \'etant une zone de fortes mar\'ees, avec des fonds de faibles profondeurs sur de grandes \'etendues et soumise \`a de forts courants, le frottement de fond a une influence primordiale. Nous avons donc apport\'e un effort important pour affiner la prise en compte de ce frottement par le mod\`ele. D'autre part, tant la faiblesse des fonds marin que la complexit\'e de la g\'eographie induisent \'egalement une forte influence du trait de c\^otes et de la bathym\'etrie. En cons\'equence, une part importante des efforts a \'et\'e d\'edi\'ee \`a \'etablir un trait de c\^otes et une bathym\'etrie de la zone aussi pr\'ecis que possible. La mar\'ee \'etant le ph\'enom\`ene hydrodynamique de plus forte amplitude dans la zone, nous nous sommes focalis\'es sur sa mod\'elisation. Les d\'eveloppements \'evoqu\'es pr\'ec\'edemment ont permis, lorsque l'on compare notre meilleure solution de mar\'ee avec les donn\'ees in situ et satellites, d'am\'eliorer sensiblement la mod\'elisation de la mar\'ee. En comparant notre meilleure solution avec celles d\'ej\`a publi\'ees, celle-ci est plus proche des donn\'ees collect\'ees. Ceci ouvre la voie \`a une mod\'elisation hydrodynamique plus compl\`ete, en particulier du transport.},

Yet the classical computation of the so-called Sobol' indices is based on Monte Carlo simulation, which is not af- fordable when computationally expensive models are used, as it is the case in most applications in engineering and applied sciences. In this respect metamodels such as polynomial chaos expansions (PCE) and Gaussian processes (GP) have received tremendous attention in the last few years, as they allow one to replace the original, taxing model by a surrogate which is built from an experimental design of limited size. Then the surrogate can be used to compute the sensitivity indices in negligible time. In this chapter an introduction to each technique is given, with an emphasis on their strengths and limitations in the context of global sensitivity analysis. In particular, Sobol' (resp. total Sobol') indices can be computed analytically from the PCE coefficients. In contrast, confidence intervals on sensitivity indices can be derived straightforwardly from the properties of GPs. The performance of the two techniques is finally compared on three well-known analytical benchmarks (Ishigami, G-Sobol and Morris functions) as well as on a realistic engineering application (deflection of a truss structure).},

A key problem in robust optimization is that the mean and the variation of a response cannot be calculated easily. This research presents an implementation of the approximate statistical moment method based on the Kriging metamodel. Furthermore, the statistics using the second-order statistical approximation method are adopted to avoid the local robust optimum. Thus, the probability of design-success, which is defined as the probability of satisfying the imposed design requirements, is represented as a function of approximate mean and variance. The formulation for the robust optimization can be defined as the probability of design-success of each response. The mathematical problem and the design problems of a two-bar structure and microgyroscope are investigated for the validation of the proposed method.},

Control variables, also called manufacturing variables, are determined by a product designer while environmental variables, called noise variables in the quality control literature, are uncontrolled in the field but take values that are characterized by a probability distribution. Our goal is to find a set of control variables at which the response is insensitive to the value of the environmental variables, a ``robust'' choice of control variables. Such a choice ensures that the mean response is as insensitive as possible to perturbations of the nominal environmental variable distribution. We present a sequential strategy to select the inputs at which to observe the response so as to determine a robust setting of the control variables. Our solution is Bayesian; the prior takes the response as a draw from a stationary Gaussian stochastic process. Given the previous information, the sequential algorithm computes for each untested site the ``improvement'' over the current guess of the optimal robust setting. The design selects the next site to maximize the expected improvement criterion.},

  abstract = {1. Ecological count data typically exhibit complexities such as overdispersion and zero-inflation, and are often weakly associated with a relatively large number of correlated covariates. The use of an appropriate statistical model for inference is therefore essential. A common selection criteria for choosing between nested models is the likelihood ratio test (LRT). Widely used alternatives to the LRT are based on information-theoretic metrics such as the Akaike Information Criterion. 2. It is widely believed that the LRT can only be used to compare the performance of nested models \textendash{} i.e. in situations where one model is a special case of another. There are many situations in which it is important to compare non-nested models, so, if true, this would be a substantial drawback of using LRTs for model comparison. In reality, however, it is actually possible to use the LRT for comparing both nested and non-nested models. This fact is well-established in the statistical literature, but not widely used in ecological studies. 3. The main obstacle to the use of the LRT with non-nested models has, until relatively recently, been the fact that it is difficult to explicitly write down a formula for the distribution of the LRT statistic under the null hypothesis that one of the models is true. With modern computing power it is possible to overcome this difficulty by using a simulation-based approach. 4. To demonstrate the practical application of the LRT to both nested and non-nested model comparisons, a case study involving data on questing tick (Ixodes ricinus) abundance is presented. These data contain complexities typical in ecological analyses, such as zero-inflation and overdispersion, for which comparison between models of differing structure \textendash{} e.g. non-nested models \textendash{} is of particular importance. 5. Choosing between competing statistical models is an essential part of any applied ecological analysis. The LRT is a standard statistical test for comparing nested models. By use of simulation the LRT can also be used in an analogous fashion to compare non-nested models, thereby providing a unified approach for model comparison within the null hypothesis testing paradigm. A simple practical guide is provided in how to apply this approach to the key models required in the analyses of count data.},

Therefore it is desirable to construct an accurate surrogate model for the system response and subsequently to sample the surrogate model. In this paper we discuss the properties of this approach. We demonstrate that the straightforward sampling of a surrogate model can lead to erroneous results, no matter how accurate the surrogate model is. We then propose a hybrid approach by sampling both the surrogate model in a ``large'' portion of the probability space and the original system in a ``small'' portion. The resulting algorithm is significantly more efficient than the traditional sampling method, and is more accurate and robust than the straightforward surrogate model approach. Rigorous convergence proof is established for the hybrid approach, and practical implementation is discussed. Numerical examples are provided to verify the theoretical findings and demonstrate the efficiency gain of the approach.},

  abstract = {In the process of calibrating distributed hydrological models, accounting for input uncertainty is important, yet challenging. In this study, we develop a Bayesian model to estimate parameters associated with a geomorphology?based hydrological model (GBHM). The GBHM model uses geomorphic characteristics to simplify model structure and physically based methods to represent hydrological processes. We divide the observed discharge into low? and high?flow data, and use the first?order autoregressive model to describe their temporal dependence. We consider relative errors in rainfall as spatially distributed variables and estimate them jointly with the GBHM parameters. The joint posterior probability distribution is explored using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, which include Metropolis?Hastings, delay rejection adaptive Metropolis, and Gibbs sampling methods. We evaluate the Bayesian model using both synthetic and field data sets. The synthetic case study demonstrates that the developed method generally is effective in calibrating GBHM parameters and in estimating their associated uncertainty. The calibration ignoring input errors has lower accuracy and lower reliability compared to the calibration that includes estimation of the input errors, especially under model structure uncertainty. The field case study shows that calibration of GBHM parameters under complex field conditions remains a challenge. Although jointly estimating input errors and GBHM parameters improves the continuous ranked probability score and the consistency of the predictive distribution with the observed data, the improvement is incremental. To better calibrate parameters in a distributed model, such as GBHM here, we need to develop a more complex model and incorporate much more information.},

The traditional, double-loop RBDO algorithm requires nested optimization loops, where the design optimization (outer) loop, repeatedly calls a series of reliability (inner) loops. Due to the nested optimization loops, the computational effort can be prohibitive for practical problems. A single-loop RBDO algorithm is proposed in this paper for both normal and nonnormal random variables. Its accuracy is the same with the double-loop approach and its efficiency is almost equivalent to deterministic optimization. It collapses the nested optimization loops into an equivalent single-loop optimization process by imposing the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions of the reliability loops as equivalent deterministic equality constraints of the design optimization loop. It therefore, converts the probabilistic optimization problem into an equivalent deterministic optimization problem, eliminating the need for calculating the Most Probable Point (MPP) in repeated reliability assessments. Several numerical applications including an automotive vehicle side impact example, demonstrate the accuracy and superior efficiency of the proposed single-loop RBDO algorithm.},

Three types of null hypotheses are considered: equality of mean vectors, homogeneity of covariance matrices, and equality of both mean vectors and covariance matrices. We demonstrate that the likelihood ratio test statistics have finite-sample distributions that are functions of two independent Wishart variables and dependent on the covariance matrix of the combined multiple populations. Asymptotic calculations show that the likelihood ratio test statistics converge in distribution to central Chi-squared distributions under the null hypotheses regardless of how the populations are correlated. Following these theoretical findings, we propose a resampling procedure for the implementation of the likelihood ratio tests in which no restrictive assumption is imposed on the structures of the covariance matrices. The empirical size and power of the test procedure are investigated for various sample sizes via simulations. Two examples are provided for illustration. The results show good performance of the methods in terms of test validity and power.},

Furthermore, Bayesian inference enables an independent regularization scheme where each coefficient (or weight) is associated with an independent regularization parameter.

With the assimilation of these data, we aim at reconstructing the four-dimensional space-time circulation of the ocean including the vertical. This problem is solved using the variational technique and the adjoint method. In the present case, a strong constraint approach is assumed, i.e. the quasi-geostrophic ocean circulation model used is assumed to be exact. The control vector is chosen as being the initial state of the dynamical system and it should minimize the mean-square difference between the model solution and the observed data. The assimilation procedure has been implemented and has the ability to transfer the surface data information downward to the deep flows, and hence to reconstruct the oceanic circulation in the various layers used to describe the vertical stratification of the ocean. The paper points out more specifically the crucial influence of the choice of the norm in the vector control space on the convergence speed of the optimization algorithm. Furthermore, various temporal strategies to perform the assimilation are presented and discussed with regard to their ability to properly control the initial state (which is the actual control variable) and the final state.},

Instead, multiple plausible futures need to be considered, which requires (i) uncertainties to be described with the aid of scenarios that represent coherent future pathways based on different sets of assumptions, (ii) system performance to be represented by metrics that measure insensitivity (i.e. robustness) to changes in future conditions, and (iii) adaptive strategies to be considered alongside their more commonly used static counterparts. However, while these factors have been considered in isolation previously, there has been a lack of discussion of the way they are connected.

  abstract = {The goal of the paper is to design sequential strategies which lead to efficient optimization of an unknown function under the only assumption that it has a finite Lipschitz constant. We first identify sufficient conditions for the consistency of generic sequential algorithms and formulate the expected minimax rate for their performance. We introduce and analyze a first algorithm called LIPO which assumes the Lipschitz constant to be known. Consistency, minimax rates for LIPO are proved, as well as fast rates under an additional H\textasciidieresis older like condition. An adaptive version of LIPO is also introduced for the more realistic setup where the Lipschitz constant is unknown and has to be estimated along with the optimization. Similar theoretical guarantees are shown to hold for the adaptive LIPO algorithm and a numerical assessment is provided at the end of the paper to illustrate the potential of this strategy with respect to state-of-the-art methods over typical benchmark problems for global optimization.},

Consequently, insight into characteristics of the weighted sum method has far reaching implications. However, despite the many published applications for this method and the literature addressing its pitfalls with respect to depicting the Pareto optimal set, there is little comprehensive discussion concerning the conceptual significance of the weights and techniques for maximizing the effectiveness of the method with respect to a priori articulation of preferences. Thus, in this paper, we investigate the fundamental significance of the weights in terms of preferences, the Pareto optimal set, and objective-function values. We determine the factors that dictate which solution point results from a particular set of weights. Fundamental deficiencies are identified in terms of a priori articulation of preferences, and guidelines are provided to help avoid blind use of the method.},

  abstract = {The global sensitivity analysis of a complex numerical model often requires the estimation of variance-based importance measures, called Sobol' indices. Metamodel-based techniques have been developed in order to replace the cpu time expensive computer code with an inexpensive mathematical function, predicting the computer code output. The common metamodel-based sensitivity analysis methods are appropriate with computer codes having scalar model output. However, in the environmental domain, as in many areas of application, numerical models often give as output a spatial map, which is sometimes a spatio-temporal evolution, of some interest variables. In this paper, we introduce a novel way to obtain a spatial map of Sobol' indices with a minimal number of numerical model computations. It is based on the functional decomposition of the spatial output onto a wavelet basis and the metamodeling of the wavelet coefficients by Gaussian process. An analytical example allows us to clarify the various steps of our methodology. This technique is then applied to a real case of hydrogeological modeling: for each model input variable, a spatial map of Sobol' indices is thus obtained.},

  abstract = {Natural gradient descent is an optimization method traditionally motivated from the perspective of information geometry, and works well for many applications as an alternative to stochastic gradient descent. In this paper we critically analyze this method and its properties, and show how it can be viewed as a type of 2nd-order optimization method, with the Fisher information matrix acting as a substitute for the Hessian. In many important cases, the Fisher information matrix is shown to be equivalent to the Generalized Gauss-Newton matrix, which both approximates the Hessian, but also has certain properties that favor its use over the Hessian. This perspective turns out to have significant implications for the design of a practical and robust natural gradient optimizer, as it motivates the use of techniques like trust regions and Tikhonov regularization. Additionally, we make a series of contributions to the understanding of natural gradient and 2nd-order methods, including: a thorough analysis of the convergence speed of stochastic natural gradient descent (and more general stochastic 2nd-order methods) as applied to convex quadratics, a critical examination of the oft-used ``empirical'' approximation of the Fisher matrix, and an analysis of the (approximate) parameterization invariance property possessed by natural gradient methods (which we show also holds for certain other curvature matrices, but notably not the Hessian).},

  abstract = {Multidisciplinary design optimization is a field of research that studies the application of numerical optimization techniques to the design of engineering systems involving multiple disciplines or components. Since the inception of multidisciplinary design optimization, various methods (architectures) have been developed and applied to solve multidisciplinary design-optimization problems. This paper provides a survey of all the architectures that have been presented in the literature so far. All architectures are explained in detail using a unified description that includes optimization problem statements, diagrams, and detailed algorithms. The diagrams show both data and process flow through the multidisciplinary system and computational elements, which facilitate the understanding of the various architectures, and how they relate to each other. A classification of the multidisciplinary design-optimization architectures based on their problem formulations and decomposition strategies is also provided, and the benefits and drawbacks of the architectures are discussed from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. For each architecture, several applications to the solution of engineering-design problems are cited. The result is a comprehensive but straightforward introduction to multidisciplinary design optimization for nonspecialists and a reference detailing all current multidisciplinary design-optimization architectures for specialists.

  abstract = {Given an m\texttimes n matrix A and a positive integer k, we describe a randomized procedure for the approximation of A with a matrix Z of rank k. The procedure relies on applying AT to a collection of l random vectors, where l is an integer equal to or slightly greater than k; the scheme is efficient whenever A and AT can be applied rapidly to arbitrary vectors. The discrepancy between A and Z is of the same order as lm times the (k+1)st greatest singular value {$\sigma$}k+1 of A, with negligible probability of even moderately large deviations. The actual estimates derived in the paper are fairly complicated, but are simpler when l-k is a fixed small nonnegative integer. For example, according to one of our estimates for l-k=20, the probability that the spectral norm {$\Vert$}A-Z{$\Vert$} is greater than 10(k+20)m{$\sigma$}k+1 is less than 10-17. The paper contains a number of estimates for {$\Vert$}A-Z{$\Vert$}, including several that are stronger (but more detailed) than the preceding example; some of the estimates are effectively independent of m. Thus, given a matrix A of limited numerical rank, such that both A and AT can be applied rapidly to arbitrary vectors, the scheme provides a simple, efficient means for constructing an accurate approximation to a singular value decomposition of A. Furthermore, the algorithm presented here operates reliably independently of the structure of the matrix A. The results are illustrated via several numerical examples.},

The input variables of these computer experiments are assumed to be of two types. Control variables must be tuned while environmental variables have an undesirable effect, to which the design of the control variables should be robust. The algorithm to be proposed searches for a minimax solution, i.e., values of the control variables that minimize the maximum of the objective function with respect to the environmental variables. The problem is particularly difficult when the control and environmental variables live in continuous spaces. Combining a relaxation procedure with Krigingbased optimization makes it possible to deal with the continuity of the variables and the fact that no analytical expression of the objective function is available in most real-case problems. Numerical experiments are conducted to assess the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm, both on analytical test functions with known results and on an engineering application.},

  abstract = {We present the fundamentals of a measure transport approach to sampling. The idea is to construct a deterministic coupling\textemdash i.e., a transport map\textemdash between a complex ``target'' probability measure of interest and a simpler reference measure. Given a transport map, one can generate arbitrarily many independent and unweighted samples from the target simply by pushing forward reference samples through the map. If the map is endowed with a triangular structure, one can also easily generate samples from conditionals of the target measure. We consider two different and complementary scenarios: first, when only evaluations of the unnormalized target density are available, and second, when the target distribution is known only through a finite collection of samples. We show that in both settings the desired transports can be characterized as the solutions of variational problems. We then address practical issues associated with the optimization\textendash based construction of transports: choosing finite-dimensional parameterizations of the map, enforcing monotonicity, quantifying the error of approximate transports, and refining approximate transports by enriching the corresponding approximation spaces. Approximate transports can also be used to ``Gaussianize'' complex distributions and thus precondition conventional asymptotically exact sampling schemes. We place the measure transport approach in broader context, describing connections with other optimization\textendash based samplers, with inference and density estimation schemes using optimal transport, and with alternative transformation\textendash based approaches to simulation. We also sketch current work aimed at the construction of transport maps in high dimensions, exploiting essential features of the target distribution (e.g., conditional independence, low-rank structure). The approaches and algorithms presented here have direct applications to Bayesian computation and to broader problems of stochastic simulation.},

  abstract = {Abstract Three-dimensional variational data assimilation (3D-Var) with the first guess at appropriate time (FGAT) appears to be an attractive compromise between accuracy and overall computing time. It is computationally cheaper than four-dimensional (4D)-Var as the increment is not propagated back and forth in time by a model, yet the comparison between the model and the observations is still computed at the right observation time. An interesting feature of the 4D-Var is the iterative process known as the outer loop. This outer-loop approach can also be used in conjunction with 3D-FGAT. But it requires the application of the 3D-FGAT analysis increment at the beginning of the assimilation window. The pros and cons of using this unusual 3D-FGAT variant are illustrated in this paper on two applications focused on the transport, one of the main phenomena governing the atmospheric evolution. The first one is the one-dimensional advection of a passive tracer. By three representative situations, it shows the benefits of the outer loop, except for practical situations driven by very rapid dynamics such as a zonal wind of 50 m s-1 on the earth's great circle, when the assimilation window has a size of 3 h. The second application is the 3D-FGAT assimilation of true ozone measurements into a chemical\textendash transport model. It confirms the previous results, showing that the 3D-FGAT analysis with the outer loop produces an overestimation of the ozone increment in regions where the wind speed is high compared to the time length of the assimilation window.},

Recent studies have shown that the application of different robustness metrics can result in different rankings of decision alternatives, but there has been little discussion of what potential causes for this might be. To shed some light on this issue, we present a unifying framework for the calculation of robustness metrics, which assists with understanding how robustness metrics work, when they should be used, and why they sometimes disagree. The framework categorizes the suitability of metrics to a decision-maker based on (1) the decision-context (i.e., the suitability of using absolute performance or regret), (2) the decision-maker's preferred level of risk aversion, and (3) the decision-maker's preference toward maximizing performance, minimizing variance, or some higher-order moment. This article also introduces a conceptual framework describing when relative robustness values of decision alternatives obtained using different metrics are likely to agree and disagree. This is used as a measure of how ``stable'' the ranking of decision alternatives is when determined using different robustness metrics. The framework is tested on three case studies, including water supply augmentation in Adelaide, Australia, the operation of a multipurpose regulated lake in Italy, and flood protection for a hypothetical river based on a reach of the river Rhine in the Netherlands. The proposed conceptual framework is confirmed by the case study results, providing insight into the reasons for disagreements between rankings obtained using different robustness metrics.},

This process is to establish a connection between the Recurrent Neural Network and the discrete differential equation, so as to construct a new network structure: ODE-RU. At the same time, under the inspiration of the theory of ordinary differential equations, we propose a new forward propagation mode. In a large number of simulations and experiments, the forward propagation not only shows the trainability of the new architecture, but also achieves a low training error on the basis of main-taining the stability of the network. For the problem requiring long-term memory, we specifically study the obstacle shape reconstruction problem using the backscattering far-field features data set, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture using the data set. The results show that the network can effectively reduce the sensitivity to small changes in the input feature. And the error generated by the ordinary differential equation cyclic unit network in inverting the shape and position of obstacles is less than \$ 10\^\{-2\} \$.{$<$}/p{$><$}/abstract{$>$}},

  abstract = {The treatment of cloud structure in numerical weather and climate models is often greatly simplified to make them computationally affordable. Here we propose to correct the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts 1D radiation scheme ecRad for 3D cloud effects using computationally cheap neural networks. 3D cloud effects are learned as the difference between ecRad's fast 1D Tripleclouds solver that neglects them and its 3D SPARTACUS (SPeedy Algorithm for Radiative TrAnsfer through CloUd Sides) solver that includes them but is about five times more computationally expensive. With typical errors between 20\% and 30\% of the 3D signal, neural networks improve Tripleclouds' accuracy for about 1\% increase in runtime. Thus, rather than emulating the whole of SPARTACUS, we keep Tripleclouds unchanged for cloudfree parts of the atmosphere and 3D-correct it elsewhere. The focus on the comparably small 3D correction instead of the entire signal allows us to improve predictions significantly if we assume a similar signal-to-noise ratio for both.},

  abstract = {Adjoint methods are nowadays widely used to efficiently perform optimization for problems with a large number of design variables. However, in reality, the problem at hand might be subjected to uncertainties in the operational conditions or, in case of optimizing geometries, the design variables itself might be uncertain due to manufacturing tolerances. For such applications, the optimum obtained using deterministic methods might be very sensitive to small variations in the uncertainties, i.e. it lacks robustness. In a robust optimization, the uncertainties are taken directly into account during the optimization process by introducing, next to the mean objective, its variance as a second objective. This implies that, when using gradient based optimization methods, the gradients of both objectives (mean and variance) must be known. In this work the Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) is used in combination with adjoint methods to efficiently obtain both gradients. A non intrusive, regression based PCE is used, requiring a new adjoint solution for each sampling point in order to build the PCE of the gradient. A PCE for the objective is also built (at no extra cost) in order to compute the gradient of the variance.},

In this paper, the application of two control strategies for the improvement of wind turbine power output is investigated in the presence of model/environmental uncertainties. Rotational speed of the wind turbine and consequently its power output are controlled via manipulation of blades pitch angle (at a constant generator torque). First, the classical PID controller is designed based on root locus analysis while in the second scheme, an H{$\infty$}-robust controller is designed via {$\mu$}-synthesis based on DK-iteration algorithm. Performance of the two controllers in tracking of the desired power outputs (including the step, sequence of steps, ramp and sinusoidal signals) is compared. Results are presented for various profiles of the wind speed. It is shown that H{$\infty$} controller guarantees the robust stability and performance of the uncertain systems. Moreover, when H{$\infty$} controller is implemented, less oscillatory behaviour is observed for both of the output power and pitch angles (which are desired for the electric grid and actuating systems, respectively).},

While variability is always central to the definition of robustness, the concept does contain ambiguity and although subtle, this ambiguity can have significant influence on the strategies used to combat variability, the way it is quantified and ultimately, the quality of the final design. In this contribution the literature for robustness metrics was systematically reviewed. From the 108 relevant publications found, 38 metrics were determined to be conceptually different from one another. The metrics were classified by their meaning and interpretation based on the types of information necessary to calculate the metrics. Four different classes were identified: 1) Sensitivity robustness metrics; 2) Size of feasible design space robustness metrics; 3) Functional expectancy and dispersion robustness metrics; and 4) Probability of compliance robustness metrics. The goal was to give a comprehensive overview of robustness metrics and guidance to scholars and practitioners to understand the different types of robustness metrics and to remove the ambiguities of the term robustness. By applying an exemplar metric from each class to a case study, the differences between the classes were further highlighted. These classes form the basis for the definition of four specific sub-definitions of robustness, namely the `robust concept', `robust design', `robust function' and `robust product'.},

The result of our computations are parameters that lead to simulations that are compatible with the data. We demonstrate the usefulness of our implicit sampling algorithm with an example from subsurface flow. For an efficient implementation we make use of multiple grids, BFGS optimization coupled to adjoint equations, and Karhunen-Lo`eve expansions for dimensional reduction. Moreover, several difficulties of Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, e.g. estimation of burn-in times or correlations among the samples, are avoided because the implicit samples are independent.},

Taking them into account is crucial in industrial design problems and this might be achieved through reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) techniques. In this paper, we propose a quantile-based approach to solve RBDO problems. We first transform the safety constraints usually formulated as admissible probabilities of failure into constraints on quantiles of the performance criteria. In this formulation, the quantile level controls the degree of conservatism of the design. Starting with the premise that industrial applications often involve high-fidelity and time-consuming computational models, the proposed approach makes use of Kriging surrogate models (a.k.a. Gaussian process modeling). Thanks to the Kriging variance (a measure of the local accuracy of the surrogate), we derive a procedure with two stages of enrichment of the design of computer experiments (DoE) used to construct the surrogate model. The first stage globally reduces the Kriging epistemic uncertainty and adds points in the vicinity of the limit-state surfaces describing the system performance to be attained. The second stage locally checks, and if necessary, improves the accuracy of the quantiles estimated along the optimization iterations. Applications to three analytical examples and to the optimal design of a car body subsystem (minimal mass under mechanical safety constraints) show the accuracy and the remarkable efficiency brought by the proposed procedure.},

We formulate a general nonparametric estimator for such a model and show under high-level assumptions that the speed of convergence is independent of dimension. We further discuss a particular implementation for which we validate the high-level assumptions and establish its asymptotic normality. Simulation experiments illustrate a large gain in finite sample performance when the simplifying assumption is at least approximately true. But even when it is severely violated, the vine copula based approach proves advantageous as soon as more than a few variables are involved. Lastly, we give an application of the estimator to a classification problem from astrophysics.},

Cette m\'ethode est bas\'ee sur l'utilisation des \'equations adjointes au second ordre, obtenues en prenant l'adjoint du syst\`eme d'optimalit\'e. La sensibilit\'e en est d\'eduite par inversion du Hessien de la fonction co\^ut via la minimisation d'une fonctionnelle quadratique. L'application est faite sur un mod\`ele de circulation g\'en\'erale oc\'eanique de type quasi-g\'eostrophique, et nous faisons aussi l'\'etude de l'existence et l'unicit\'e de la solution de l'\'equation adjointe au second ordre du mod\`ele consid\'er\'e, pour justifier l'utilisation du Hessien et l'applicabilit\'e de notre m\'ethode. Nous \'etudions aussi l'influence de la configuration spatio-temporelle des observations sur le processus d'assimilation au travers du Hessien (\`a l'optimum) dont les \'el\'ements propres varient lorsqu'on fait varier la configuration. Enfin, nous \'etudions la pr\'edicibilit\'e du syst\`eme d'optimalit\'e.},

  abstract = {Abstract The difference between the strong and weak constraints four-dimensional variational (4DVAR) analyses is examined using the representer method formulation, which expresses the analysis as the sum of a first guess and a finite linear combination of representer functions. The latter are computed analytically for a single observation under both strong and weak constraints assumptions. Even though the strong constraints representer coefficients are different from their weak constraints counterparts, that difference is unable to help the strong constraints compensate for the loss of information that the weak constraints includes. Numerical experiments carried out in the Agulhas retroflection for single and multiobservation assimilations clearly show that the weak constraint 4DVAR produces analyses that fit the observations with significantly higher accuracy than the strong constraints.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating a conditional density in moderately large dimensions. Much more informative than regression functions, conditional densities are of main interest in recent methods, particularly in the Bayesian framework (studying the posterior distribution, finding its modes...). Considering a recently studied family of kernel estimators, we select a pointwise multivariate bandwidth by revisiting the greedy algorithm Rodeo (Regularisation Of Derivative Expectation Operator). The method addresses several issues: being greedy and computationally efficient by an iterative procedure, avoiding the curse of high dimensionality under some suitably defined sparsity conditions by early variable selection during the procedure, converging at a quasi-optimal minimax rate.},

However, the identification of governing equations remains challenging when dealing with noisy and partial observations. Here, we address this challenge and investigate variational deep learning schemes. Within the proposed framework, we jointly learn an inference model to reconstruct the true states of the system and the governing laws of these states from series of noisy and partial data. In doing so, this framework bridges classical data assimilation and state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. We also demonstrate that it generalises stateof-the-art methods. Importantly, both the inference model and the governing model embed stochastic components to account for stochastic variabilities, model errors, and reconstruction uncertainties. Various experiments on chaotic and stochastic dynamical systems support the relevance of our scheme w.r.t. state-of-the-art approaches.},

This approach can result in improved numerical methods for solving partial differential equations by eliminating the need to discretise the volume of the analysis domain. Instead only an unstructured distribution of collocation points throughout the volume is needed. An NN approximation of relevant variables for the whole domain based on these data points is then achieved. Excellent test results are obtained. It is shown how the method of approximation can then be used as part of a boundary element method (BEM) for the analysis of viscoelastic flows. Planar Couette and Poiseuille flows are used as illustrative examples.},

To implement a hierarchical clustering algorithm, one has to choose a linkage function (single linkage, average linkage, complete linkage, Ward linkage, etc.) that defines the distance between any two sub-sets (and rely on the base distance between elements). A hierarchical clustering is monotonous if and only if the similarity decreases along the path from any leaf to the root, otherwise there exists at least one inversion. The single, complete, and average linkage criteria guarantee the monotonic property, but not the often used Ward's criterion.},

  journal = {Wikip\'edia},
  abstract = {En statistique, la distance de Mahalanobis est une mesure de distance math\'ematique introduite par Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis en 1936. Elle est bas\'ee sur la corr\'elation entre des variables par lesquelles diff\'erents mod\`eles peuvent \^etre identifi\'es et analys\'es. C'est une mani\`ere utile de d\'eterminer la similarit\'e entre une s\'erie de donn\'ees connues et inconnues. Elle diff\`ere de la distance euclidienne par le fait qu'elle prend en compte la variance et la corr\'elation de la s\'erie de donn\'ees. Ainsi, \`a la diff\'erence de la distance euclidienne o\`u toutes les composantes des vecteurs sont trait\'ees ind\'ependamment et de la m\^eme fa\c{c}on, la distance de Mahalanobis accorde un poids moins important aux composantes les plus dispers\'ees. Dans le cas de l'analyse des signaux, et en supposant que chaque composante soit une variable al\'eatoire de type gaussien, cela revient \`a minimiser l'influence des composantes les plus bruit\'ees (celles ayant la plus grande variance). La distance de Mahalanobis est souvent utilis\'ee pour la d\'etection de donn\'ees aberrantes dans un jeu de donn\'ees, ou bien pour d\'eterminer la coh\'erence de donn\'ees fournies par un capteur par exemple : cette distance est calcul\'ee entre les donn\'ees re\c{c}ues et celles pr\'edites par un mod\`ele. En pratique, la distance de Mahalanobis d'un vecteur \`a plusieurs variables                         x         =         (                    x                        1                             ,                    x                        2                             ,                    x                        3                             ,         \ldots{}         ,                    x                        p                                        )                        T                                     \{\textbackslash displaystyle x=(x\_\{1\},x\_\{2\},x\_\{3\},\textbackslash dots ,x\_\{p\})\^\{T\}\}    \`a un ensemble de vecteurs de valeurs moyennes                         {$\mu$}         =         (                    {$\mu$}                        1                             ,                    {$\mu$}                        2                             ,                    {$\mu$}                        3                             ,         \ldots{}         ,                    {$\mu$}                        p                                        )                        T                                     \{\textbackslash displaystyle \textbackslash mu =(\textbackslash mu \_\{1\},\textbackslash mu \_\{2\},\textbackslash mu \_\{3\},\textbackslash dots ,\textbackslash mu \_\{p\})\^\{T\}\}    et poss\'edant une matrice de covariance {$\Sigma$} est d\'efinie comme suit :                                   D                        M                             (         x         )         =                                 (             x             -             {$\mu$}                            )                                T                                                        {$\Sigma$}                                -                 1                                         (             x             -             {$\mu$}             )                             .                          \{\textbackslash displaystyle D\_\{M\}(x)=\{\textbackslash sqrt \{(x-\textbackslash mu )\^\{T\}\textbackslash Sigma \^\{-1\}(x-\textbackslash mu )\}\}.\textbackslash,\}   La distance de Mahalanobis peut aussi \^etre d\'efinie comme \'etant la mesure de dissimilarit\'e entre deux vecteurs al\'eatoires                                                                x               \textrightarrow{}                                                  \{\textbackslash displaystyle \{\textbackslash vec \{x\}\}\}    et                                                                y               \textrightarrow{}                                                  \{\textbackslash displaystyle \{\textbackslash vec \{y\}\}\}    de m\^eme distribution avec une matrice de covariance {$\Sigma$} :                        d         (                                                x               \textrightarrow{}                                          ,                                                y               \textrightarrow{}                                          )         =                                 (                                                                x                   \textrightarrow{}                                                          -                                                                y                   \textrightarrow{}                                                                         )                                T                                                        {$\Sigma$}                                -                 1                                         (                                                                x                   \textrightarrow{}                                                          -                                                                y                   \textrightarrow{}                                                          )                             .                          \{\textbackslash displaystyle d(\{\textbackslash vec \{x\}\},\{\textbackslash vec \{y\}\})=\{\textbackslash sqrt \{(\{\textbackslash vec \{x\}\}-\{\textbackslash vec \{y\}\})\^\{T\}\textbackslash Sigma \^\{-1\}(\{\textbackslash vec \{x\}\}-\{\textbackslash vec \{y\}\})\}\}.\textbackslash,\}   Si la matrice de covariance est la matrice identit\'e, cette distance est simplement la distance euclidienne.

  pages = {38},
  abstract = {In many engineering optimization problems, the number of function evaluations is severely limited by time or cost. These problems pose a special challenge to the field of global optimization, since existing methods often require more function evaluations than can be comfortably afforded. One way to address this challenge is to fit response surfaces to data collected by evaluating the objective and constraint functions at a few points. These surfaces can then be used for visualization, tradeoff analysis, and optimization. In this paper, we introduce the reader to a response surface methodology that is especially good at modeling the nonlinear, multimodal functions that often occur in engineering. We then show how these approximating functions can be used to construct an efficient global optimization algorithm with a credible stopping rule. The key to using response surfaces for global optimization lies in balancing the need to exploit the approximating surface (by sampling where it is minimized) with the need to improve the approximation (by sampling where prediction error may be high). Striking this balance requires solving certain auxiliary problems which have previously been considered intractable, but we show how these computational obstacles can be overcome.},

  abstract = {A deterministic computer model is to be used in a situation where there is uncertainty about the values of some or all of the input parameters. This uncertainty induces uncertainty in the output of the model. We consider the problem of estimating a specific percentile of the distribution of this uncertain output. We also suppose that the computer code is computationally expensive, so we can run the model only at a small number of distinct inputs. This means that we must consider our uncertainty about the computer code itself at all untested inputs. We model the output, as a function of its inputs, as a Gaussian process, and after a few initial runs of the code use a simulation approach to choose further suitable design points and to make inferences about the percentile of interest itself. An example is given involving a model that is used in sewer design.},

  abstract = {With the increasing role of computational modeling in engineering design, performance estimation, and safety assessment, improved methods are needed for comparing computational results and experimental measurements. Traditional methods of graphically comparing computational and experimental results, though valuable, are essentially qualitative. Computable measures are needed that can quantitatively compare computational and experimental results over a range of input, or control, variables to sharpen assessment of computational accuracy. This type of measure has been recently referred to as a validation metric. We discuss various features that we believe should be incorporated in a validation metric, as well as features that we believe should be excluded. We develop a new validation metric that is based on the statistical concept of confidence intervals. Using this fundamental concept, we construct two specific metrics: one that requires interpolation of experimental data and one that requires regression (curve fitting) of experimental data. We apply the metrics to three example problems: thermal decomposition of a polyurethane foam, a turbulent buoyant plume of helium, and compressibility effects on the growth rate of a turbulent free-shear layer. We discuss how the present metrics are easily interpretable for assessing computational model accuracy, as well as the impact of experimental measurement uncertainty on the accuracy assessment.},

Classical BO algorithms, however, do not account for errors about the location where observations are taken, which is a common issue in problems with physical components. In these cases, the estimation of the actual query location is also subject to uncertainty. In this context, we propose an upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithm for BO problems where both the outcome of a query and the true query location are uncertain. The algorithm employs a Gaussian process model that takes probability distributions as inputs. Theoretical results are provided for both the proposed algorithm and a conventional UCB approach within the uncertain-inputs setting. Finally, we evaluate each method's performance experimentally, comparing them to other input noise aware BO approaches on simulated scenarios involving synthetic and real data.},

  abstract = {A normalizing flow is an invertible mapping between an arbitrary probability distribution and a standard normal distribution; it can be used for density estimation and statistical inference. Computing the flow follows the change of variables formula and thus requires invertibility of the mapping and an efficient way to compute the determinant of its Jacobian. To satisfy these requirements, normalizing flows typically consist of carefully chosen components. Continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) are mappings obtained by solving a neural ordinary differential equation (ODE). The neural ODE's dynamics can be chosen almost arbitrarily while ensuring invertibility. Moreover, the log-determinant of the flow's Jacobian can be obtained by integrating the trace of the dynamics' Jacobian along the flow. Our proposed OT-Flow approach tackles two critical computational challenges that limit a more widespread use of CNFs. First, OT-Flow leverages optimal transport (OT) theory to regularize the CNF and enforce straight trajectories that are easier to integrate. Second, OT-Flow features exact trace computation with time complexity equal to trace estimators used in existing CNFs. On five high-dimensional density estimation and generative modeling tasks, OT-Flow performs competitively to state-of-the-art CNFs while on average requiring one-fourth of the number of weights with an 8x speedup in training time and 24x speedup in inference.},

Here we propose an information-theoretic formalization of bounded rational decision-making where decision-makers trade off expected utility and information processing costs. Such bounded rational decision-makers can be thought of as thermodynamic machines that undergo physical state changes when they compute. Their behavior is governed by a free energy functional that trades off changes in internal energy\textemdash as a proxy for utility\textemdash and entropic changes representing computational costs induced by changing states. As a result, the bounded rational decision-making problem can be rephrased in terms of well-known concepts from statistical physics. In the limit when computational costs are ignored, the maximum expected utility principle is recovered. We discuss the relation to satisficing decision-making procedures as well as links to existing theoretical frameworks and human decision-making experiments that describe deviations from expected utility theory. Since most of the mathematical machinery can be borrowed from statistical physics, the main contribution is to axiomatically derive and interpret the thermodynamic free energy as a model of bounded rational decision-making.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a strategy for improving the computational efficiency of model inversion using the method of anchored distributions (MAD) by ``bundling'' similar model parametrizations in the likelihood function. Inferring the likelihood function typically requires a large number of forward model (FM) simulations for each possible model parametrization; as a result, the process is quite expensive. To ease this prohibitive cost, we present an approximation for the likelihood function called bundling that relaxes the requirement for high quantities of FM simulations. This approximation redefines the conditional statement of the likelihood function as the probability of a set of similar model parametrizations ``bundle'' replicating field measurements, which we show is neither a model reduction nor a sampling approach to improving the computational efficiency of model inversion. To evaluate the effectiveness of these modifications, we compare the quality of predictions and computational cost of bundling relative to a baseline MAD inversion of 3-D flow and transport model parameters. Additionally, to aid understanding of the implementation we provide a tutorial for bundling in the form of a sample data set and script for the R statistical computing language. For our synthetic experiment, bundling achieved a 35\% reduction in overall computational cost and had a limited negative impact on predicted probability distributions of the model parameters. Strategies for minimizing error in the bundling approximation, for enforcing similarity among the sets of model parametrizations, and for identifying convergence of the likelihood function are also presented.},

  abstract = {Full-waveform inversion (FWI) has emerged as a powerful strategy for estimating the subsurface model parameters by iteratively minimizing the difference between the synthetic data and observed data. The gradient-based methods promise to converge globally but suffer from slow convergence rate. The Newton-type methods provide a quadratic convergence, but the computation, storage and inversion of the Hessian are beyond the current computation ability for large-scale inverse problem. The Hessian-free (HF) optimization method represents an attractive alternative to these above-mentioned optimization methods. At each iteration, it obtains the search direction by approximately solving the Newton linear system using a conjugate-gradient (CG) algorithm with a matrix-free fashion. One problem of the HF optimization method is that the CG algorithm requires many iterations. The main goal of this paper is to accelerate the HF FWI by preconditioning the CG algorithm. In this research, different preconditioning schemes for the HF Gauss-Newton optimization method are developed. The preconditioners are designed as Hessian approximations (e.g., diagonal pseudo-Hessian and diagonal Gauss-Newton Hessian) or its inverse approximations. We also developed a new pseudo diagonal Gauss-Newton Hessian approximation for preconditioning based on the reciprocal property of the Green's function. Furthermore, a quasi-Newton l-BFGS inverse Hessian approximation preconditioner with the diagonal Hessian approximation as initial guess is proposed and developed. Several numerical examples are solved to demonstrate the effectiveness of the preconditioning schemes. It is concluded that the quasi-Newton l-BFGS preconditioning scheme with the pseudo diagonal Gauss-Newton Hessian as initial guess shows the best performances in speeding up the HF Gauss-Newton FWI, improving the convergence rate and reducing the computation burden.},

The study is formalized as a Bayesian optimization problem, or continuous multi-armed bandit problem, where a batch of q {$>$} 0 arms is pulled in parallel at each iteration. Several algorithms have been developed for choosing batches by trading off exploitation and exploration. As of today, the maximum Expected Improvement (EI) and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) selection rules appear as the most prominent approaches for batch selection. Here, we build upon recent work on the multipoint Expected Improvement criterion, for which an analytic expansion relying on Tallis' formula was recently established. The computational burden of this selection rule being still an issue in application, we derive a closed-form expression for the gradient of the multipoint Expected Improvement, which aims at facilitating its maximization using gradient-based ascent algorithms. Substantial computational savings are shown in application. In addition, our algorithms are tested numerically and compared to state-of-the-art UCB-based batch-sequential algorithms. Combining starting designs relying on UCB with gradient-based EI local optimization finally appears as a sound option for batch design in distributed Gaussian Process optimization.},

  abstract = {Robust design has been developed with the expectation that an insensitive design can be obtained. That is, a product designed by robust design should be insensitive to external noises or tolerances. An insensitive design has more probability to obtain a target value, although there are uncertain noises. Theories of robust design have been developed by adopting the theories of other fields. Based on the theories, robust design can be classified into three methods: 1) the Taguchi method, 2) robust optimization, and 3) robust design with the axiomatic approach. Each method is reviewed and investigated. The methods are examined from a theoretical viewpoint and are discussed from an application viewpoint. The advantages and drawbacks of each method are discussed, and future directions for development are proposed.

  abstract = {Rare event dedicated techniques are of great interest for the aerospace industry because of the large amount money that can be lost because of risks associated with minute probabilities. This thesis is focused on the search of probability techniques able to estimate rare event probabilities and extreme quantiles associated with a black box system with static random inputs through two case studies from the industry. The first one is the estimation of the probability of collision between satellites Iridium and Cosmos. The Cross-Entropy (CE), the Non-parametric Adaptive Importance Sampling (NAIS) and an Adaptive Splitting Technique (AST) are compared. Through the comparison, an improved version of NAIS is designed. Whereas NAIS needs to be initiated with a auxiliary random variable which straight away generates rare events, the Adaptive NAIS (ANAIS) allows one to use the original input random as initial auxiliary density and therefore does not require a priori knowledge. The second case is the estimation of the safety zone with respect to the fall of a spacecraft booster. Though they can be estimated via ANAIS or AST, extreme quantiles are shown to be not adapted to spatial distribution. For that purpose, the Minimum Volume Set (MVS) is chosen from the literature. The Crude Monte Carlo (CMC) plug-in MVS estimator being not adapted to extreme level MVS estimation, both ANAIS and AST are adapted into plug-in extreme MVS estimators. These two algorithms outperform the CMC plug-in MVS estimator.},

PyTorch is a machine learning library that shows that these two goals are in fact compatible: it provides an imperative and Pythonic programming style that supports code as a model, makes debugging easy and is consistent with other popular scientific computing libraries, while remaining efficient and supporting hardware accelerators such as GPUs. In this paper, we detail the principles that drove the implementation of PyTorch and how they are reflected in its architecture. We emphasize that every aspect of PyTorch is a regular Python program under the full control of its user. We also explain how the careful and pragmatic implementation of the key components of its runtime enables them to work together to achieve compelling performance. We demonstrate the efficiency of individual subsystems, as well as the overall speed of PyTorch on several common benchmarks.},

Cet \'etat initial est reconstitu\'e en combinant les informations provenant du mod\`ele et des observations disponibles en utilisant des techniques d'assimilation de donn\'ees. Historiquement, les pr\'evisions et l'assimilation sont r\'ealis\'ees dans l'atmosph\`ere et l'oc\'ean de mani\`ere d\'ecoupl\'ee. Cependant, les centres op\'erationnels d\'eveloppent et utilisent de plus en plus des mod\`eles coupl\'es oc\'ean-atmosph\`ere. Or, assimiler des donn\'ees de mani\`ere d\'ecoupl\'ee n'est pas satisfaisant pour des syst\`emes coupl\'es. En effet, l'\'etat initial ainsi obtenu pr\'esente des inconsistances de flux \`a l'interface entre les milieux, engendrant des erreurs de pr\'evision. Il y a donc besoin d'adapter les m\'ethodes d'assimilation aux syst\`emes coupl\'es. Ces travaux de th\`ese s'inscrivent dans ce contexte et ont \'et\'e effectu\'es dans le cadre du projet FP7 ERA-Clim2, visant \`a produire une r\'eanalyse globale du syst\`eme terrestre.Dans une premi\`ere partie, nous introduisons les notions d'assimilation de donn\'ees, de couplage et les diff\'erentes m\'ethodologies existantes appliqu\'ees au probl\`eme de l'assimilation coupl\'ee. Ces m\'ethodologies n'\'etant pas satisfaisantes en terme de qualit\'e de couplage ou de co\^ut de calcul, nous proposons, dans une seconde partie, des m\'ethodes alternatives. Nous faisons le choix de m\'ethodes d'assimilation bas\'ees sur la th\'eorie du contr\^ole optimal. Ces alternatives se distinguent alors par le choix de la fonction co\^ut \`a minimiser, des variables contr\^ol\'ees et de l'algorithme de couplage utilis\'e. Une \'etude th\'eorique de ces algorithmes a permis de d\'eterminer un crit\`ere n\'ecessaire et suffisant de convergence dans un cadre lin\'eaire. Pour conclure cette seconde partie, les performances des diff\'erentes m\'ethodes introduites sont \'evalu\'ees en terme de qualit\'e de l'analyse produite et de co\^ut de calcul \`a l'aide d'un mod\`ele coupl\'e lin\'eaire 1D. Dans une troisi\`eme et derni\`ere partie, un mod\`ele coupl\'e non-lin\'eaire 1D incluant des param\'etrisations physique a \'et\'e d\'evelopp\'e et impl\'ement\'e dans OOPS (textit\{Object-Oriented Prediction System\}) qui est une surcouche logicielle permettant la mise en \oe uvre d'un ensemble d'algorithmes d'assimilation de donn\'ees. Nous avons alors pu \'evaluer la robustesse de nos algorithmes dans un cadre plus r\'ealiste, et conclure sur leurs performances vis \`a vis de m\'ethodes existantes. Le fait d'avoir d\'evelopp\'e nos m\'ethodes dans le cadre de OOPS devrait permettre \`a l'avenir de les appliquer ais\'ement \`a des mod\`eles r\'ealistes de pr\'evision.

To achieve this, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are implemented as pretrained surrogate models to replace key components of the DA cycle in numerical weather prediction (NWP), including the conventional numerical forecast model, the forecast error covariance matrix, and the tangent linear and adjoint models. It is shown how these RNNs can be initialized using DA methods to directly update the hidden/reservoir state with observations of the target system. The results indicate that these techniques can be applied to estimate the state of a system for the repeated initialization of short-term forecasts, even in the absence of a traditional numerical forecast model. Further, it is demonstrated how these integrated RNN-DA methods can scale to higher dimensions by applying domain localization and parallelization, providing a path for practical applications in NWP.},

  abstract = {We address the numerical solution of infinite-dimensional inverse problems in the framework of Bayesian inference. In the Part I companion to this paper (arXiv.org:1308.1313), we considered the linearized infinite-dimensional inverse problem. Here in Part II, we relax the linearization assumption and consider the fully nonlinear infinite-dimensional inverse problem using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling method. To address the challenges of sampling high-dimensional pdfs arising from Bayesian inverse problems governed by PDEs, we build on the stochastic Newton MCMC method. This method exploits problem structure by taking as a proposal density a local Gaussian approximation of the posterior pdf, whose construction is made tractable by invoking a low-rank approximation of its data misfit component of the Hessian. Here we introduce an approximation of the stochastic Newton proposal in which we compute the low-rank-based Hessian at just the MAP point, and then reuse this Hessian at each MCMC step. We compare the performance of the proposed method to the original stochastic Newton MCMC method and to an independence sampler. The comparison of the three methods is conducted on a synthetic ice sheet inverse problem. For this problem, the stochastic Newton MCMC method with a MAP-based Hessian converges at least as rapidly as the original stochastic Newton MCMC method, but is far cheaper since it avoids recomputing the Hessian at each step. On the other hand, it is more expensive per sample than the independence sampler; however, its convergence is significantly more rapid, and thus overall it is much cheaper. Finally, we present extensive analysis and interpretation of the posterior distribution, and classify directions in parameter space based on the extent to which they are informed by the prior or the observations.},

Capitalizing on the ability of Neural Networks techniques for approximating the solution of PDE's, we incorporate Deep Learning (DL) methods into a DA framework. More precisely, we exploit the latent structure provided by autoencoders (AEs) to design an Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter with model error (ETKF-Q) in the latent space. Model dynamics are also propagated within the latent space via a surrogate neural network. This novel ETKF-Q-Latent (thereafter referred to as ETKF-Q-L) algorithm is tested on a tailored instructional version of Lorenz 96 equations, named the augmented Lorenz 96 system: it possesses a latent structure that accurately represents the observed dynamics. Numerical experiments based on this particular system evidence that the ETKF-Q-L approach both reduces the computational cost and provides better accuracy than state of the art algorithms, such as the ETKF-Q.},

  abstract = {The majority of tidal energy convertors (TECs) currently under development are of a non-yawing horizontal axis design. However, most energetic regions that have been identified as candidate sites for installation of TEC arrays exhibit some degree of directional and magnitude asymmetry between incident flood and ebb flow angles and velocities, particularly in nearshore environments where topographic, bathymetric and seabed frictional effects and interactions are significant. Understanding the contribution of directional and magnitude asymmetry to resource power density along with off axis rotor alignment to flow could influence site selection and help elucidate optimal turbine orientation. Here, 2D oceanographic model simulations and field data were analysed to investigate these effects at potential deployment locations in the Irish Sea; an energetic semi-enclosed shelf sea region. We find that observed sites exhibiting a high degree of asymmetry may be associated with a reduction of over 2\% in annual energy yield when deployment design optimisation is ignored. However, at the majority of sites, even in the presence of significant asymmetry, the difference is {$<$}0.3\%. Although the effects are shown to have less significance than other uncertainties in resource assessment, these impacts could be further investigated and quantified using CFD and 3D modelling.},

In this article, a comprehensive comparison of existing kriging-based methods for the optimization of noisy functions is provided. Ten methods are described using a unified formalism, and compared on analytical benchmark problems with different configurations (noise level, maximum number of observations, initial number of observations).

  abstract = {L'apprentissage automatique a re\c{c}u beaucoup d'attention au cours des deux derni\`eres d\'ecennies, \`a la fois de la part de l'industrie pour des probl\`emes de d\'ecision bas\'es sur des donn\'ees et de la communaut\'e scientifique en g\'en\'eral. Cette attention r\'ecente est certainement due \`a sa capacit\'e \`a r\'esoudre efficacement une large classe de probl\`emes en grande dimension gr\^ace \`a des algorithmes rapides et faciles \`a mettre en oeuvre. Quel est le type de probl\`emes abord\'es par l'apprentissage automatique ? D'une mani\`ere g\'en\'erale, r\'epondre \`a cette question n\'ecessite de le diviser en deux th\`emes distincts: l'apprentissage supervis\'e et l'apprentissage non supervis\'e. Ces deux axes principaux trouvent un \'echo dans cette th\`ese. Dans un premier temps, la partie concernant l'apprentissage supervis\'e \'etudie th\'eoriquement la pierre angulaire de toutes les techniques d'optimisation li\'ees \`a ces probl\`emes: les m\'ethodes de gradient stochastique. Gr\^ace \`a leur polyvalence, elles participent largement au r\'ecent succ\`es de l'apprentissage. Cependant, malgr\'e leur simplicit\'e, leur efficacit\'e n'est pas encore pleinement comprise. L'\'etude de certaines propri\'et\'es de cet algorithme est l'une des deux questions importantes de cette th\`ese. Dans un second temps, la partie consacr\'ee \`a l'apprentissage non supervis\'e est li\'ee \`a un probl\`eme plus sp\'ecifique : nous concevons dans cette \'etude un algorithme pour trouver des mod\`eles r\'eduits pour des dynamiques emprunt\'ees \`a la physique. Cette partie aborde une question cruciale en physique statistique computationnelle (\'egalement appel\'ee dynamique mol\'eculaire). M\^eme si les deux probl\`emes sont de nature diff\'erente, ces deux directions partagent une caract\'eristique commune : elles tirent parti de l'utilisation d'espaces \`a noyau reproduisant, qui poss\`edent deux propri\'et\'es essentielles : (i) ils s'adaptent naturellement au cadre stochastique tout en pr\'eservant une certaine efficacit\'e num\'erique, (ii) ils montrent une grande expressivit\'e en tant que classe de fonctions de test. La premi\`ere contribution de cette th\`ese est de montrer la convergence exponentielle de la descente de gradient stochastique pour la perte binaire dans le cas o\`u la t\^ache de classification est facile. Ce travail \'etablit \'egalement des bornes th\'eoriques fines sur la descente de gradient stochastique dans les espaces \`a noyau reproduisant, ce qui peut \^etre consid\'er\'e comme un r\'esultat en lui-m\^eme. La deuxi\`eme contribution se concentre sur l'optimalit\'e de la descente de gradient stochastique dans le cadre non param\'etrique pour des probl\`emes de r\'egression. Plus pr\'ecis\'ement, ce travail est le premier \`a montrer que de multiples passages sur les donn\'ees permettent d'atteindre l'optimalit\'e dans certains cas o\`u l'optimum de Bayes est difficile \`a approcher. Ce travail tente de r\'econcilier la th\'eorie et la pratique car les travaux actuels sur la descente de gradient stochastique ont toujours montr\'e qu'il suffisait d'un passage sur les donn\'ees. En physique statistique computationnelle comme en apprentissage automatique, la question de trouver des repr\'esentations de faible dimension (principaux degr\'es de libert\'e) est cruciale. Telle est la question abord\'ee par la troisi\`eme contribution de cette th\`ese. Nous montrons plus pr\'ecis\'ement comment il est possible d'estimer la constante de Poincar\'e d'une distribution \`a travers des \'echantillons de celle-ci. Ensuite, nous exploitons cette estimation pour concevoir un algorithme \`a la recherche de coordonn\'ees de r\'eaction qui sont les pierres angulaires des techniques d'acc\'el\'eration dans le contexte de la dynamique mol\'eculaire. D\'etailler, affiner et \'etendre ce r\'esultat est la quatri\`eme contribution de ce manuscrit.},

For when the mean return vector and variance/covariance matrix of the risky assets are specified without specifying a return distribution, we derive distributionally robust portfolio rules. We then address potential uncertainty (ambiguity) in the mean return vector as well, in addition to distribution ambiguity, and derive a closed-form portfolio rule for when the uncertainty in the return vector is modelled via an ellipsoidal uncertainty set. Our result also indicates a choice criterion for the radius of ambiguity of the ellipsoid. Using the adjustable robustness paradigm we extend the single-period results to multiple periods, and derive closed-form dynamic portfolio policies which mimic closely the single-period policy.},

  abstract = {A study is made of the limits imposed on variational assimilation of observations by the chaotic character of the atmospheric flow. The primary goal of the study is to determine to which degree, and how, the knowledge of past noisy observations can improve the knowledge of the present state of a chaotic system. The study is made under the hypothesis of a perfect model. Theoretical results are illustrated by numerical experiments performed with the classical three-variable system introduced by Lorenz. Both theoretical and numerical results show that, even in the chaotic regime, appropriate use of past observations improves the accuracy on the estimate of the present state of the flow. However, the resulting estimation error mostly projects onto the unstable modes of the system, and the corresponding gain in predictability is limited. Theoretical considerations provide explicit estimates of the statistics of the assimilation error. The error depends on the state of the flow over the assimilation period. It is largest when there has been a period of strong instability in the very recent past. In the limit of infinitely long assimilation periods, the behaviour of the cost-function of variational assimilation is singular: it tends to fold into deep narrow ``valleys'' parallel to the sheets of the unstable manifold of the system. An unbounded number of secondary minima appear, where solutions of minimization algorithms can be trapped. The absolute minimum of the cost-function always lies on the sheet of the unstable manifold containing the exact state of the flow. But the error along the unstable manifold saturates to a finite value, and the absolute minimum of the cost function does not, in general, converge to the exact state of the flow. Even so, the absolute minimum of the cost function is the best estimate that can be obtained of the state of the flow. An algorithm is proposed, the quasi-static variational assimilation, for determining the absolute minimum, based on successive small increments of the assimilation period and quasi-static adjustments of the minimizing solution. Finally, the impact of assimilation on predictability is assessed by forecast experiments with that system. The ability of the present paper lies mainly in the qualitative results it presents. Qualitative estimates relevant for the atmosphere call for further studies.},

  abstract = {Estimating the model parameters from measured data generally consists of minimizing an error functional. A classic technique to solve a minimization problem is to successively determine the minimum of a series of linearized problems. This formulation requires the Fr\'echet derivatives (the Jacobian matrix), which can be expensive to compute. If the minimization is viewed as a non-linear optimization problem, only the gradient of the error functional is needed. This gradient can be computed without the Fr\'echet derivatives. In the 1970s, the adjoint-state method was developed to efficiently compute the gradient. It is now a well-known method in the numerical community for computing the gradient of a functional with respect to the model parameters when this functional depends on those model parameters through state variables, which are solutions of the forward problem. However, this method is less well understood in the geophysical community. The goal of this paper is to review the adjoint-state method. The idea is to define some adjoint-state variables that are solutions of a linear system. The adjoint-state variables are independent of the model parameter perturbations and in a way gather the perturbations with respect to the state variables. The adjoint-state method is efficient because only one extra linear system needs to be solved. Several applications are presented. When applied to the computation of the derivatives of the ray trajectories, the link with the propagator of the perturbed ray equation is established.},

This model is a full general circulation model with on-line fully interactive chemistry involving 127 gas-phase and heterogeneous reactions. Thus, feedback between dynamics, chemistry and radiation occurs in every model time step. In this work, validation of the system for tropospheric and lower stratospheric analyses is undertaken with the standard observation set used in operational weather forecasting. Results are found to agree reasonably well with radiosonde observations and with Met Office (UK) analyses. Although ozone is not assimilated, ozone fields match total column observations well in terms of synoptic patterns. However, due to model biases, total column values are too large at mid-latitudes and too small in the tropics. Since the assimilation scheme was designed for tropospheric weather prediction, its application to a middle atmosphere model can help to identify the challenges of assimilating data from this region of the atmosphere.},

In particular, we identify conditions under which a first-stage decision can be obtained either exactly using popular adjustable robust optimization decomposition schemes, or approximately by conservatively employing affine decision rules. Furthermore, we provide both numerical and theoretical evidence that in practice the first-stage decision obtained using affine decision rules is of high quality. Initially, this is done by establishing mild conditions under which these decisions can be proven exact, which effectively extends the space of regret minimization problems known to be solvable in polynomial time. We further evaluate both the sub-optimality and computational efficiency of this tractable approximation scheme in a multi-item newsvendor problem and a production transportation problem.},

To provide rigorous insight into EI, we study its properties in a simple setting of Bayesian optimization where the domain consists of a finite grid of points. This is the so-called best-arm identification problem, where the goal is to allocate measurement effort wisely to confidently identify the best arm using a small number of measurements. In this framework, one can show formally that EI is far from optimal. To overcome this shortcoming, we introduce a simple modification of the expected improvement algorithm. Surprisingly, this simple change results in an algorithm that is asymptotically optimal for Gaussian best-arm identification problems, and provably outperforms standard EI by an order of magnitude.},

  abstract = {Data assimilation is the process to fuse information from priors, observations of nature, and numerical models, in order to obtain best estimates of the parameters or state of a physical system of interest. Presence of large errors in some observational data, e.g., data collected from a faulty instrument, negatively affect the quality of the overall assimilation results. This work develops a systematic framework for robust data assimilation. The new algorithms continue to produce good analyses in the presence of observation outliers. The approach is based on replacing the traditional \$\textbackslash L\_2\$ norm formulation of data assimilation problems with formulations based on \$\textbackslash L\_1\$ and Huber norms. Numerical experiments using the Lorenz-96 and the shallow water on the sphere models illustrate how the new algorithms outperform traditional data assimilation approaches in the presence of data outliers.},

We propose a method able to deal with cases characterized by multiple failure regions, possibly very small failure probability pf (say {$\sim$}10-6-10-9), and when the number of evaluations of J is limited. The present work is an extension of the popular Kriging-based active learning algorithm known as AK-MCS, as presented in [1], permitting to deal with very low failure probabilities. The key idea merely consists in replacing the Monte-Carlo sampling, used in the original formulation to propose candidates and evaluate the failure probability, by a centered isotropic Gaussian sampling in the standard space, whose standard deviation is iteratively tuned. This extreme AK-MCS (eAK-MCS) inherits its former multi-point enrichment algorithm allowing to add several points at each iteration step, and provide an estimated failure probability based on the Gaussian nature of the Kriging surrogate. Both the efficiency and the accuracy of the proposed method are showcased through its application to two to eight dimensional analytic examples, characterized by very low failure probabilities: pf{$\sim$}10-6-10-9. Numerical experiments conducted with unfavorable initial Design of Experiment suggests the ability of the proposed method to detect failure domains.},

Systematic optimization methods accounting for multiple uncertainties due to variable operating conditions, referred to as Robust Optimization may benefit to ORC turbines aerodynamic design. This study presents an original and fast robust shape optimization approach to overcome the limitation of a deterministic optimization that neglects operating conditions variability, applied to a well-known supersonic turbine nozzle for ORC applications. The flow around the blade is assumed inviscid and adiabatic and it is reconstructed using the opensource SU2 code. The non-ideal gasdynamics is modeled through the Peng-Robinson-Stryjek-Vera equation of state. We propose here a mono-objective formulation which consists in minimizing the {$\alpha$}-quantile of the targeted Quantity of Interest (QoI) under a probabilistic constraint, at a low computational cost. This problem is solved by using an efficient robust optimization approach, coupling a state-of-the-art quantile estimation and a classical Bayesian optimization method. First, the advantages of a quantile-based formulation are illustrated with respect to a conventional mean-based robust optimization. Secondly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of applying this robust optimization framework with a low-fidelity inviscid solver by comparing the resulting optimal design with the ones obtained with a deterministic optimization using a fully turbulent solver.},

  abstract = {Cette th\`ese vise \`a formuler des m\'ethodes innovantes de quantification d'incertitude (UQ) \`a la fois pour l'optimisation robuste (RO) et l'optimisation robuste et fiable (RBDO). L'application vis\'ee est l'optimisation des turbines supersoniques pour les Cycles Organiques de Rankine (ORC).Les sources d'\'energie typiques des syst\`emes d'alimentation ORC sont caract\'eris\'ees par une  source de chaleur et des conditions thermodynamiques entr\'ee/sortie de turbine variables. L'utilisation de compos\'es organiques, g\'en\'eralement  de masse mol\'eculaire \'elev\'ee, conduit \`a des configurations de turbines sujettes \`a des \'ecoulements supersoniques et des chocs, dont l'intensit\'e augmente dans les conditions off-design; ces caract\'eristiques d\'ependent \'egalement de la forme locale de la p\^ale, qui peut \^etre influenc\'ee par la variabilit\'e g\'eom\'etrique induite par les proc\'edures de fabrication. Il existe un consensus sur la n\'ecessit\'e d'inclure ces incertitudes dans la conception, n\'ecessitant ainsi des m\'ethodes UQ et un outil permettant l'optimisation de form adapt\'e.Ce travail est d\'ecompos\'e en deux parties principales. La premi\`ere partie aborde le probl\`eme de l'estimation des \'ev\'enements rares en proposant deux m\'ethodes originales pour l'estimation de probabilit\'e de d\'efaillance (metaAL-OIS et eAK-MCS) et un pour le calcul quantile (QeAK-MCS). Les trois m\'ethodes reposent sur des strat\'egies d'adaptation bas\'ees sur des m\'etamod\`eles (Kriging), visant \`a affiner directement la r\'egion dite Limit-State-Surface (LSS), contrairement aux methodes de type Subset Simulation (SS). En effet, ces derni\`eres consid\`erent  diff\'erents seuils interm\'ediaires associ\'es \`a des  LSSs devant \^etre raffin\'es. Cette propri\'et\'e de raffinement direct est cruciale, car elle permet la compatibilit\'e de couplage \`a des m\'ethodes RBDO existantes.En particulier, les algorithmes propos\'es ne sont pas soumis \`a des hypoth\`eses restrictives sur le LSS (contrairement aux m\'ethodes de type FORM/SORM), tel que le nombre de modes de d\'efaillance, cependant doivent \^etre formul\'es dans l'espace standard. Les m\'ethodes eAK-MCS et QeAK-MCS sont d\'eriv\'ees de la m\'ethode AK-MCS, et d'un \'echantillonnage adaptatif et parall\`ele bas\'e sur des algorithmes de type K-Means pond\'er\'e. MetaAL-OIS pr\'esente une strat\'egie de raffinement s\'equentiel plus \'elabor\'ee bas\'ee sur des \'echantillons MCMC tir\'es \`a partir d'une densit\'e d'\'echantillonage d'importance (ISD) quasi optimale. Par ailleurs, il propose la construction d'une ISD de type m\'elange de gaussiennes, permettant l'estimation pr\'ecise de petites probabilit\'es de d\'efaillance lorsqu'un grand nombre d'\'echantillons (plusieurs millions) est disponible, comme alternative au SS. Les trois m\'ethodes sont tr\`es performantes pour des exemples analytiques 2D \`a 8D  classiques, tir\'es de la litt\'erature sur la fiabilit\'e des  structures, certaines pr\'esentant plusieurs modes de d\'efaillance, et tous caract\'eris\'es par une tr\`es faible probabilit\'e de d\'efaillance/niveau de quantile. Des estimations pr\'ecises sont obtenues pour  les cas consid\'er\'es en un nombre raisonnable  d'appels \`a la fonction de performance.},

Most applications of variational inference employ simple families of posterior approximations in order to allow for efficient inference, focusing on mean-field or other simple structured approximations. This restriction has a significant impact on the quality of inferences made using variational methods. We introduce a new approach for specifying flexible, arbitrarily complex and scalable approximate posterior distributions. Our approximations are distributions constructed through a normalizing flow, whereby a simple initial density is transformed into a more complex one by applying a sequence of invertible transformations until a desired level of complexity is attained. We use this view of normalizing flows to develop categories of finite and infinitesimal flows and provide a unified view of approaches for constructing rich posterior approximations. We demonstrate that the theoretical advantages of having posteriors that better match the true posterior, combined with the scalability of amortized variational approaches, provides a clear improvement in performance and applicability of variational inference.},

  abstract = {Dans le secteur de l'automobile, les turbomachines sont des machines tournantes participant au refroidissement des moteurs des voitures. Leur performance d\'epend de multiples param\`etres g\'eom\'etriques qui d\'eterminent leur forme. Cette th\`ese s'inscrit dans le projet ANR PEPITO r\'eunissant industriels et acad\'emiques autour de l'optimisation de ces turbomachines. L'objectif du projet est de trouver la forme du ventilateur maximisant le rendement en certains points de fonctionnement. Dans ce but, les industriels ont d\'evelopp\'e des codes CFD (computational fluid dynamics) simulant le fonctionnement de la machine. Ces codes sont tr\`es co\^uteux en temps de calcul. Il est donc impossible d'utiliser directement le r\'esultat de ces simulations pour conduire une optimisation.Par ailleurs, lors de la construction des turbomachines, on observe des perturbations sur les param\`etres d'entr\'ee. Elles sont le reflet de fluctuations des machines de production. Les \'ecarts observ\'es sur la forme g\'eom\'etrique finale de la turbomachine peuvent provoquer une perte de performance cons\'equente. Il est donc n\'ecessaire de prendre en compte ces perturbations et de proc\'eder \`a une optimisation robuste \`a ces fluctuations. Dans ce travail de th\`ese, nous proposons des m\'ethodes bas\'ees sur du krigeage r\'epondant aux deux principales probl\'ematiques li\'ees \`a ce contexte de simulations co\^uteuses :\textbullet{}	Comment construire une bonne surface de r\'eponse pour le rendement lorsqu'il y a beaucoup de param\`etres g\'eom\'etriques ?\textbullet{}	Comment proc\'eder \`a une optimisation du rendement efficace tout en prenant en compte les perturbations des entr\'ees ?Nous r\'epondons \`a la premi\`ere probl\'ematique en proposant plusieurs algorithmes permettant de construire un noyau de covariance pour le krigeage adapt\'e \`a la grande dimension. Ce noyau est un produit tensoriel de noyaux isotropes o\`u chacun de ces noyaux est li\'e \`a un sous groupe de variables d'entr\'ee. Ces algorithmes sont test\'es sur des cas simul\'es et sur une fonction r\'eelle. Les r\'esultats montrent que l'utilisation de ce noyau permet d'am\'eliorer la qualit\'e de pr\'ediction en grande dimension. Concernant la seconde probl\'ematique, nous proposons plusieurs strat\'egies it\'eratives bas\'ees sur un co-krigeage avec d\'eriv\'ees pour conduire l'optimisation robuste. A chaque it\'eration, un front de Pareto est obtenu par la minimisation de deux objectifs calcul\'es \`a partir des pr\'edictions de la fonction co\^uteuse. Le premier objectif repr\'esente la fonction elle-m\^eme et le second la robustesse. Cette robustesse est quantifi\'ee par un crit\`ere estimant une variance locale et bas\'ee sur le d\'eveloppement de Taylor. Ces strat\'egies sont compar\'ees sur deux cas tests en petite et plus grande dimension. Les r\'esultats montrent que les meilleures strat\'egies permettent bien de trouver l'ensemble des solutions robustes. Enfin, les m\'ethodes propos\'ees sont appliqu\'ees sur les cas industriels propres au projet PEPITO.},

The multi objective methodology for robust optimization that requires the partitioning of the Pareto front (minimization of the function and the robustness criterion) has already been developed. However, the efficient estimation of the robustness criterion in the context of time-consuming simulation has not been much explored. We propose a robust optimization procedure based on the prediction of the function and its derivatives by a kriging. The 15 usual moment 2 is replaced by an approximated version using Taylor theorem. A Pareto front of the robust solutions is generated by a genetic algorithm named NSGA-II. This algorithm gives a Pareto front in an reasonable time of calculation. We detail seven relevant strategies and compare them for the same budget in two test functions (2D and 6D). In each case, we compare the results when the derivatives are observed and not.},

They accounted for 33,6\% of the number of total shots in 2017-2018, compared to only 3\% in 1979-1980 [1]. In this paper, we aim at better understanding the connections between the type of 3-point shooting (catch-and-shoots and pull-ups) and the timing for shooting, using two distinct space-time models of player motion. Those models allow us to identify individual behavior as a function of specific defensive settings, e.g. shot-behavior when a player is guarded closely. We assess our models using SportVU data for specific NBA players and our code is open-source to enable more players and teams explorations, as well as to support further research and application of those models, beyond basketball and sport.},

Our acquisition function is a lower bound on the well-known Expected Improvement function, which requires evaluation of a Gaussian Expectation over a multivariate piecewise affine function. Our bound is computed instead by evaluating the best-case expectation over all probability distributions consistent with the same mean and variance as the original Gaussian distribution. Unlike alternative approaches, including Expected Improvement, our proposed acquisition function avoids multi-dimensional integrations entirely, and can be computed exactly - even on large batch sizes - as the solution of a tractable convex optimization problem. Our suggested acquisition function can also be optimized efficiently, since first and second derivative information can be calculated inexpensively as by-products of the acquisition function calculation itself. We derive various novel theorems that ground our work theoretically and we demonstrate superior performance via simple motivating examples, benchmark functions and real-world problems.},

This tutorial covers the algorithm and its application, illustrating concepts through a range of examples, including Bernoulli bandit problems, shortest path problems, dynamic pricing, recommendation, active learning with neural networks, and reinforcement learning in Markov decision processes. Most of these problems involve complex information structures, where information revealed by taking an action informs beliefs about other actions.

Through geometry, seemingly distinct ideas are presented as the result of one common principle, making econometrics more than mere recipes or special tricks. In doing this, the author relies on such concepts as the linear vector space, orthogonality, and distance. Parts I and II introduce the ordinary least squares fitting method and the classical linear regression model, separately rather than simultaneously as in other texts. Part III contains generalizations of the classical linear regression model and Part IV develops the latent variable models that distinguish econometrics from statistics. To motivate formal results in a chapter, the author begins with substantive empirical examples. Main results are followed by illustrative special cases; technical proofs appear toward the end of each chapter. Intended for a graduate audience, An Introduction to Classical Econometric Theory fills the gap between introductory and more advanced texts. It is the most conceptually complete text for graduate econometrics courses and will play a vital role in graduate instruction.},

  abstract = {Abstract The study considers an iterative formulation of the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) for strongly nonlinear systems in the perfect-model framework. In the first part, a scheme is introduced that is similar to the ensemble randomized maximal likelihood (EnRML) filter by Gu and Oliver. The two new elements in the scheme are the use of the ensemble square root filter instead of the traditional (perturbed observations) EnKF and rescaling of the ensemble anomalies with the ensemble transform matrix from the previous iteration instead of estimating sensitivities between the ensemble observations and ensemble anomalies at the start of the assimilation cycle by linear regression. A simple modification turns the scheme into an ensemble formulation of the iterative extended Kalman filter. The two versions of the algorithm are referred to as the iterative EnKF (IEnKF) and the iterative extended Kalman filter (IEKF). In the second part, the performance of the IEnKF and IEKF is tested in five numerical experiments: two with the 3-element Lorenz model and three with the 40-element Lorenz model. Both the IEnKF and IEKF show a considerable advantage over the EnKF in strongly nonlinear systems when the quality or density of observations are sufficient to constrain the model to the regime of mainly linear propagation of the ensemble anomalies as well as constraining the fast-growing modes, with a much smaller advantage otherwise. The IEnKF and IEKF can potentially be used with large-scale models, and can represent a robust and scalable alternative to particle filter (PF) and hybrid PF\textendash EnKF schemes in strongly nonlinear systems.},

(2012) to extend the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) and improve its performance in mildly up to strongly nonlinear cases. However, the IEnKF assumes that the model is perfect. This assumption simplified the update of the system at a time different from the observation time, which made it natural to apply the IEnKF for smoothing. In this study, we generalise the IEnKF to the case of imperfect model with additive model error. The new method called IEnKF-Q conducts a Gauss-Newton minimisation in ensemble space. It combines the propagated analysed ensemble anomalies from the previous cycle and model noise ensemble anomalies into a single ensemble of anomalies, and by doing so takes an algebraic form similar to that of the IEnKF. The performance of the IEnKF-Q is tested in a number of experiments with the Lorenz-96 model, which show that the method consistently outperforms both the EnKF and the IEnKF naively modified to accommodate additive model noise.},

Usually the size of the problem is too large to be solved via direct factorization.

We propose an innovative approach employing Machine Learning, in particular a Convolutional Neural Network, to unassistedly design preconditioning matrices specifically for the problem at hand. Based on an in-depth case study in fluid simulation we are able to show that our learned preconditioner is able to improve the convergence rate even beyond well established methods like incomplete Cholesky factorization or Algebraic MultiGrid.},

  abstract = {Mean shift clustering finds the modes of the data probability density by identifying the zero points of the density gradient. Since it does not require to fix the number of clusters in advance, the mean shift has been a popular clustering algorithm in various application fields. A typical implementation of the mean shift is to first estimate the density by kernel density estimation and then compute its gradient. However, since a good density estimation does not necessarily imply an accurate estimation of the density gradient, such an indirect two-step approach is not reliable. In this paper, we propose a method to directly estimate the gradient of the log-density without going through density estimation. The proposed method gives the global solution analytically and thus is computationally efficient. We then develop a mean-shift-like fixed-point algorithm to find the modes of the density for clustering. As in the mean shift, one does not need to set the number of clusters in advance. We experimentally show that the proposed clustering method significantly outperforms the mean shift especially for high-dimensional data.},

Since then and especially since the launch of the satellite magnetometer mission Swarm, electromagnetic tidal observations from satellites are used increasingly to infer electric properties of the upper lithosphere. In most of these inversions, numerical ocean tidal models are used to generate oceanic tidal electromagnetic signals via electromagnetic induction. The modelled signals are subsequently compared to the satellite observations. During the inversion, since the tidal models are considered error free, discrepancies between forward models and observations are projected only onto the induction part of the modelling, e.g., Earth's resistivity distribution. Our study analyses uncertainties in oceanic tidal models from an electromagnetic point of view. Velocities from hydrodynamic and assimilative tidal models are converted into tidal electromagnetic signals and compared. Respective uncertainties are estimated. The studies main goal is to provide errors for electromagnetic inversion studies. At satellite height, the differences between the hydrodynamic tidal models are found to reach up to 2 nT, i.e., over 100 \% of the M2 signal. Assimilative tidal models show smaller differences of up to 0.1 nT, i.e., over 30 \% of the M2 signal.},

We study an OUU formulation that minimizes this distance metric over all designs. We discretize the objective function with numerical quadrature and approximate the response density function with a Gaussian kernel density estimate. We offer heuristics for addressing issues that arise in this formulation, and we apply the approach to a CFD-based airfoil shape optimization problem. We qualitatively compare the density-matching approach to a multi-objective robust design optimization to gain insight into the method.},

We derive closed form expressions for the marginal likelihood and predictive distribution of a Student-t process, by integrating away an inverse Wishart process prior over the covariance kernel of a Gaussian process model. We show surprising equivalences between different hierarchical Gaussian process models leading to Student-t processes, and derive a new sampling scheme for the inverse Wishart process, which helps elucidate these equivalences. Overall, we show that a Student-t process can retain the attractive properties of a Gaussian process -- a nonparametric representation, analytic marginal and predictive distributions, and easy model selection through covariance kernels -- but has enhanced flexibility, and predictive covariances that, unlike a Gaussian process, explicitly depend on the values of training observations. We verify empirically that a Student-t process is especially useful in situations where there are changes in covariance structure, or in applications like Bayesian optimization, where accurate predictive covariances are critical for good performance. These advantages come at no additional computational cost over Gaussian processes.},

  abstract = {Although there has been a surge of interest in density estimation in recent years, much of the published research has been concerned with purely technical matters with insufficient emphasis given to the technique's practical value. Furthermore, the subject has been rather inaccessible to the general statistician. The account presented in this book places emphasis on topics of methodological importance, in the hope that this will facilitate broader practical application of density estimation and also encourage research into relevant theoretical work. The book also provides an introduction to the subject for those with general interests in statistics. The important role of density estimation as a graphical technique is reflected by the inclusion of more than 50 graphs and figures throughout the text. Several contexts in which density estimation can be used are discussed, including the exploration and presentation of data, nonparametric discriminant analysis, cluster analysis, simulation and the bootstrap, bump hunting, projection pursuit, and the estimation of hazard rates and other quantities that depend on the density. This book includes general survey of methods available for density estimation. The Kernel method, both for univariate and multivariate data, is discussed in detail, with particular emphasis on ways of deciding how much to smooth and on computation aspects. Attention is also given to adaptive methods, which smooth to a greater degree in the tails of the distribution, and to methods based on the idea of penalized likelihood.}

  abstract = {A 2D numerical model of the shelf seas around the U.K. is used to derive the M2 tide and the M4 and M6 tidal harmonics. The accuracy of the tidal harmonics is shown to be related to the form of the dissipation. In particular a quadratic form of the bottom friction results in unrealistically high amplitudes for the M6 tide. It is shown that this effect can be reduced by use of a combination of a linearised friction tensor and quadratic friction without significantly affecting the M2 constituent. The role of diffusion in controlling the amplitude of the M4 tide is demonstrated. The 2D results provide a baseline or reference solution for further development using 3D and/or multiconstituent models. Amplitude and phase diagrams derived from the model show a progression with frequency in the North Sea and the English Channel suggestive of a transition from Kelvin wave to Poincar\'e wave propagation. It is shown that both the North Sea and the English Channel can be considered from the point of view of waves propagating in a closed channel in the presence of friction. For the inviscid case, the critical frequency above which Poincar\'e waves are able to propagate is calculated to be between the M2 and M4 frequencies for the North Sea and between the M6 and M8 frequencies for the English Channel. A dispersion relation is derived for Poincar\'e and Kelvin waves in the presence of friction. Both types of wave possess decaying and propagating characteristics when friction is present with wavelength and decay scale dependent on frequency and the coefficient of friction. There is no longer a sharp critical frequency, but instead a transition region where wavelength and decay scales vary relatively rapidly with frequency. The response of a semi-infinite rectangular channel to Kelvin and Poincar\'e wave propagation is calculated providing a partial explanation of the numerical model results. \textcopyright{} 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd},

In particular, Gauss-Newton methods are used for nonlinear inverse problems that require iterative updates to be computed from the Jacobian and allow for flexible incorporation of prior knowledge. Computationally more efficient alternatives are Quasi-Newton methods, where the repeated computation of the Jacobian is replaced by an approximate update, but unfortunately are often too restrictive for highly ill-posed problems. To overcome this limitation, we present a highly efficient data-driven Quasi-Newton method applicable to nonlinear inverse problems, by using the singular value decomposition and learning a mapping from model outputs to the singular values to compute the updated Jacobian. Enabling time-critical applications and allowing for flexible incorporation of prior knowledge necessary to solve ill-posed problems.

  abstract = {Many objectives have been proposed for optimization under uncertainty. The typical stochastic programming ob-jective of minimizing expected cost may yield solutions that are inexpensive in the long run but perform poorly under certain realizations of the random data. On the other hand, the typical robust optimization objective of minimizing maximum cost or regret tends to be overly conservative, planning against a disastrous but unlikely scenario. In this paper, we present facility location models that combine the two objectives by minimizing the expected cost while bounding the relative regret in each scenario. In particular, the models seek the minimum-expected-cost solution that is p-robust; i.e., whose relative regret is no more than 100p\% in each scenario. We present p-robust models based on two classical facility location problems, the P -median problem and the uncapacitated fixed-charge location problem. We solve both problems using variable splitting (Lagrangian decomposition), in which the subproblem reduces to the multiple-choice knapsack problem. Feasible solutions are found using an upper-bounding heuristic. For many instances of the problems, finding a feasible solution, and even determining whether the instance is feasible, is difficult; we discuss a mechanism for determining infeasibility. We also show how the algorithm can be used as a heuristic to solve minimax-regret versions of the location problems.},

  abstract = {Progress within physical oceanography has been concurrent with the increasing sophistication of tools available for its study. The incorporation of machine learning (ML) techniques offers exciting possibilities for advancing the capacity and speed of established methods and also for making substantial and serendipitous discoveries. Beyond vast amounts of complex data ubiquitous in many modern scientific fields, the study of the ocean poses a combination of unique challenges that ML can help address. The observational data available is largely spatially sparse, limited to the surface, and with few time series spanning more than a handful of decades. Important timescales span seconds to millennia, with strong scale interactions and numerical modelling efforts complicated by details such as coastlines. This review covers the current scientific insight offered by applying ML and points to where there is imminent potential. We cover the main three branches of the field: observations, theory, and numerical modelling. Highlighting both challenges and opportunities, we discuss both the historical context and salient ML tools. We focus on the use of ML in situ sampling and satellite observations, and the extent to which ML applications can advance theoretical oceanographic exploration, as well as aid numerical simulations. Applications that are also covered include model error and bias correction and current and potential use within data assimilation. While not without risk, there is great interest in the potential benefits of oceanographic ML applications; this review caters to this interest within the research community.},

  abstract = {In the Bayesian approach to inverse problems, data are often informative, relative to the prior, only on a low-dimensional subspace of the parameter space. Significant computational savings can be achieved by using this subspace to characterize and approximate the posterior distribution of the parameters. We first investigate approximation of the posterior covariance matrix as a low-rank update of the prior covariance matrix. We prove optimality of a particular update, based on the leading eigendirections of the matrix pencil defined by the Hessian of the negative log-likelihood and the prior precision, for a broad class of loss functions. This class includes the F\textbackslash "\{o\}rstner metric for symmetric positive definite matrices, as well as the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the Hellinger distance between the associated distributions. We also propose two fast approximations of the posterior mean and prove their optimality with respect to a weighted Bayes risk under squared-error loss. These approximations are deployed in an offline-online manner, where a more costly but data-independent offline calculation is followed by fast online evaluations. As a result, these approximations are particularly useful when repeated posterior mean evaluations are required for multiple data sets. We demonstrate our theoretical results with several numerical examples, including high-dimensional X-ray tomography and an inverse heat conduction problem. In both of these examples, the intrinsic low-dimensional structure of the inference problem can be exploited while producing results that are essentially indistinguishable from solutions computed in the full space.},

We analyze GP-UCB, an intuitive upper-confidence based algorithm, and bound its cumulative regret in terms of maximal information gain, establishing a novel connection between GP optimization and experimental design. Moreover, by bounding the latter in terms of operator spectra, we obtain explicit sublinear regret bounds for many commonly used covariance functions. In some important cases, our bounds have surprisingly weak dependence on the dimensionality. In our experiments on real sensor data, GP-UCB compares favorably with other heuristical GP optimization approaches.},

Traditional measures for binary and survival outcomes include the Brier score to indicate overall model performance, the concordance (or c) statistic for discriminative ability (or area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve), and goodness-of-fit statistics for calibration., Several new measures have recently been proposed that can be seen as refinements of discrimination measures, including variants of the c statistic for survival, reclassification tables, net reclassification improvement (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). Moreover, decision\textendash analytic measures have been proposed, including decision curves to plot the net benefit achieved by making decisions based on model predictions., We aimed to define the role of these relatively novel approaches in the evaluation of the performance of prediction models. For illustration we present a case study of predicting the presence of residual tumor versus benign tissue in patients with testicular cancer (n=544 for model development, n=273 for external validation)., We suggest that reporting discrimination and calibration will always be important for a prediction model. Decision-analytic measures should be reported if the predictive model is to be used for making clinical decisions. Other measures of performance may be warranted in specific applications, such as reclassification metrics to gain insight into the value of adding a novel predictor to an established model.},

Among the abundant literature on sensitivity measures, the Sobol' indices have received much attention since they provide accurate information for most models. The paper introduces generalized polynomial chaos expansions (PCE) to build surrogate models that allow one to compute the Sobol' indices analytically as a post-processing of the PCE coefficients. Thus the computational cost of the sensitivity indices practically reduces to that of estimating the PCE coefficients. An original non intrusive regression-based approach is proposed, together with an experimental design of minimal size. Various application examples illustrate the approach, both from the field of global SA (i.e. well-known benchmark problems) and from the field of stochastic mechanics. The proposed method gives accurate results for various examples that involve up to eight input random variables, at a computational cost which is 2\textendash 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the traditional Monte Carlo-based evaluation of the Sobol' indices.},

In all model-based statistical inference, the likelihood function is of central importance, since it expresses the probability of the observed data under a particular statistical model, and thus quantifies the support data lend to particular values of parameters and to choices among different models. For simple models, an analytical formula for the likelihood function can typically be derived. However, for more complex models, an analytical formula might be elusive or the likelihood function might be computationally very costly to evaluate. ABC methods bypass the evaluation of the likelihood function. In this way, ABC methods widen the realm of models for which statistical inference can be considered. ABC methods are mathematically well-founded, but they inevitably make assumptions and approximations whose impact needs to be carefully assessed. Furthermore, the wider application domain of ABC exacerbates the challenges of parameter estimation and model selection. ABC has rapidly gained popularity over the last years and in particular for the analysis of complex problems arising in biological sciences (e.g., in population genetics, ecology, epidemiology, and systems biology).},

This indirect approach exposes the insurer to model misspecification bias or estimation inefficiency, depending on whether the parameter is finite- or infinite-dimensional. In this paper, we link data and VaR directly via what we call a discrepancy function, and this leads naturally to a Gibbs posterior distribution for VaR that does not suffer from the aforementioned biases and inefficiencies.

This objective function combines observation and prior (or background) data weighted by their respective error statistics. In numerical weather prediction, data assimilation is used to estimate the current atmospheric state, which then serves as an initial condition for a forecast. New developments in the treatment of observation uncertainties have recently been shown to cause convergence problems for this least-squares minimisation. This is important for operational numerical weather prediction centres due to the time constraints of producing regular forecasts. The condition number of the Hessian of the objective function can be used as a proxy to investigate the speed of convergence of the least-squares minimisation. In this paper we develop novel theoretical bounds on the condition number of the Hessian. These new bounds depend on the minimum eigenvalue of the observation error covariance matrix and the ratio of background error variance to observation error variance. Numerical tests in a linear setting show that the location of observation measurements has an important effect on the condition number of the Hessian. We identify that the conditioning of the problem is related to the complex interactions between observation error covariance and background error covariance matrices. Increased understanding of the role of each constituent matrix in the conditioning of the Hessian will prove useful for informing the choice of correlated observation error covariance matrix and observation location, particularly for practical applications.},

  abstract = {Data assimilation algorithms combine prior and observational information, weighted by their respective uncertainties, to obtain the most likely posterior of a dynamical system. In variational data assimilation the posterior is computed by solving a nonlinear least squares problem. Many numerical weather prediction (NWP) centres use full observation error covariance (OEC) weighting matrices, which can slow convergence of the data assimilation procedure. Previous work revealed the importance of the minimum eigenvalue of the OEC matrix for conditioning and convergence of the unpreconditioned data assimilation problem. In this paper we examine the use of correlated OEC matrices in the preconditioned data assimilation problem for the first time. We consider the case where there are more state variables than observations, which is typical for applications with sparse measurements e.g. NWP and remote sensing. We find that similarly to the unpreconditioned problem, the minimum eigenvalue of the OEC matrix appears in new bounds on the condition number of the Hessian of the preconditioned objective function. Numerical experiments reveal that the condition number of the Hessian is minimised when the background and observation lengthscales are equal. This contrasts with the unpreconditioned case, where decreasing the observation error lengthscale always improves conditioning. Conjugate gradient experiments show that in this framework the condition number of the Hessian is a good proxy for convergence. Eigenvalue clustering explains cases where convergence is faster than expected.},

  abstract = {The concept presented in this paper is based on previous dynamical methods to realize a time-varying matrix inversion. It is essentially a set of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) which does indeed constitute a recurrent neural network (RNN) model. The coupled ODEs constitute a universal modeling framework for realizing a matrix inversion provided the matrix is invertible. The proposed model does converge to the inverted matrix if the matrix is invertible, otherwise it converges to an approximated inverse. Although various methods exist to solve a matrix inversion in various areas of science and engineering, most of them do assume that either the time-varying matrix inversion is free of noise or they involve a denoising module before starting the matrix inversion computation. However, in the practice, the noise presence issue is a very serious problem. Also, the denoising process is computationally expensive and can lead to a violation of the real-time property of the system. Hence, the search for a new `matrix inversion' solving method inherently integrating noise-cancelling is highly demanded. In this paper, a new combined/extended method for time-varying matrix inversion is proposed and investigated. The proposed method is extending both the gradient neural network (GNN) and the Zhang neural network (ZNN) concepts. Our new model has proven that it has exponential stability according to Lyapunov theory. Furthermore, when compared to the other previous related methods (namely GNN, ZNN, Chen neural network, and integration-enhanced Zhang neural network or IEZNN) it has a much better theoretical convergence speed. To finish, all named models (the new one versus the old ones) are compared through practical examples and both their respective convergence and error rates are measured. It is shown/observed that the novel/proposed method has a better practical convergence rate when compared to the other models. Regarding the amount of noise, it is proven that there is a very good approximation of the matrix inverse even in the presence of noise.},

Since in practice the open boundary conditions of these models are usually not known accurately, the uncertainty of these boundary conditions has to be taken into account to prevent that boundary errors are interpreted by the estimation procedure as parameter fluctuations. Therefore the open boundary conditions are embedded into a stochastic environment and a constant gain extended Kalman filter is employed to identify the state of the system. Defining a error functional that measures the differences between the filtered state of the system and the measurements, a quasi Newton method is employed to determine the minimum of this functional. To reduce the computational burden, the gradient of the criterium that is required using the quasi Newton method is determined by solving the adjoint system.},

We validate the algorithm on problems where analytical solutions are available. The numerical results are in good agreement with analytical solutions. Furthermore, we test the method on a practical problem by simulating mean flow in the Strait of Gibraltar. The main focus is to examine the performance of the LB method for complex geometries with irregular bathymetry. The results demonstrate its ability to capture the main flow features.

  abstract = {De nombreux ph\'enom\`enes physiques sont mod\'elis\'es afin d'en mieux conna\^itre les comportements ou de pouvoir les pr\'evoir. Cependant pour repr\'esenter la r\'ealit\'e, de nombreux processus doivent \^etre simplifi\'es, car ils sont souvent trop complexes, ou apparaissent \`a une \'echelle bien inf\'erieure \`a celle de l'\'etude du ph\'enom\`ene. Au lieu de compl\'etement les omettre, les effets de ces processus sont souventretranscrits dans les mod\`eles \`a l'aide de param\'etrisations, c'est-\`a-dire en introduisant des termes les quantifiant, et qui doivent \^etre ensuite estim\'ees. Les m\'ethodes classiques d'estimation se basent sur la d\'efinition d'une fonction objectif qui mesure l'\'ecart entre le mod\`ele num\'erique et la r\'ealit\'e, qui est ensuite optimis\'ee.Cependant, au del\`a de l'incertitude sur la valeur du param\`etre \`a estimer, un autre type d'incertitude peut aussi \^etre pr\'esent. Cela permet de repr\'esenter la variabilit\'e intrins\`eque de certains processusexternes, qui vont avoir un effet sur la mod\'elisation. Ces variables vont \^etre qualifi\'ees d'environnementales. En les les mod\'elisant \`a l'aide d'une variable al\'eatoire, la fonction objectif devient \`a son tour une variable al\'eatoire, que l'on va chercher \`a minimiser dans un certain sens. Si on omet ce caract\`ere al\'eatoire, on peut se retrouver avec un param\`etre optimal uniquement pour la valeur nominale du param\`etre environnemental, et le mod\`ele peut s'\'eloigner de la r\'ealit\'e pour d'autres r\'ealisations. Ce probl\`eme d'optimisation sous incertitudes est souvent abord\'e en optimisant les premiers moments de la variable al\'eatoire, l'esp\'erance en particulier.Dans cette th\`ese, nous nous int\'eressons plut\^ot \`a la notion de regret, qui mesure l'\'ecart entre la fonction objectif et la valeur optimale qu'elle peut atteindre, pour la r\'ealisation de la variable environnementale donn\'ee. Cette id\'ee de regret (additif ou bien relatif) nous permet de proposer une notion de robustesse \`a travers l'\'etude de sa probabilit\'e de d\'epasser un certain seuil, ou inversement \`a travers le calcul de ses quantiles. \`A l'aide de ce seuil, ou de l'ordre du quantile choisi, on peut donc d\'efinir une familled'estimateurs bas\'es sur le regret.N\'eanmoins, le calcul du regret, et donc des quantit\'es d\'eriv\'ees peut vite devenir tr\`es co\^uteux, car il n\'ecessite une optimisation par rapport au param\`etre de contr\^ole. Nous proposons donc d'utiliser desprocessus Gaussiens (GP) afin de construire un mod\`ele de substitution, et donc de r\'eduire cette contrainte en pratique. Nous proposons aussi des m\'ethodes it\'eratives bas\'ees notamment sur la strat\'egie SUR (Stepwise Uncertainty Reduction, R\'eduction d'incertitudes s\'equentielle): le point \`a \'evaluer ensuite est choisi selon un crit\`ere permettant d'am\'eliorer au mieux des quantit\'es associ\'ees auregret-relatif.Enfin, nous appliquons les outils pr\'esent\'es dans cette th\`ese \`a un probl\`eme acad\'emique d'estimation de param\`etre. Nous \'etudions ainsi la calibration sous incertitudes du param\`etre de friction de fond d'unmod\`ele oc\'eanique, repr\'esentant la fa\c{c}ade atlantique des c\^otes fran\c{c}aises, ainsi que la Manche dans un cadre d'exp\'eriences jumelles.},

This function measures the error between some observations and the results obtained by a numerical model. In the presence of uncontrollable additional parameters that we model as random inputs, the objective function becomes a random variable, and notions of robustness have to be introduced for such an optimisation problem. In this paper, we are going to present how to take into account those uncertainties by defining the relative-regret. This quantity allow us to compare the value of the objective function to its best performance achievable given a realisation of the random additional parameters. By controlling this relative-regret using a probabilistic constraint, we can then define a new family of estimators, whose robustness with respect to the random inputs can be adjusted.},

In this paper we propose a method for taking full advantage of the knowledge of the system's dynamical instabilities in order to improve the quality of the analysis. We present an algorithm, four-dimensional variational assimilation in the unstable subspace (4DVar-AUS), that consists in confining in this subspace the increment of the control variable. The existence of an optimal subspace dimension for this confinement is hypothesized. Theoretical arguments in favor of the present approach are supported by numerical experiments in a simple perfect non-linear model scenario. It is found that the RMS analysis error is a function of the dimension N of the subspace where the analysis is confined and is minimum for N approximately equal to the dimension of the unstable and neutral manifold. For all assimilation windows, from 1 to 5 days, 4DVar-AUS performs better than standard 4DVar. In the presence of observational noise, the 4DVar solution, while being closer to the observations, if farther away from the truth. The implementation of 4DVar-AUS does not require the adjoint integration.},

  abstract = {Incremental four-dimensional variational assimilation (4D-Var) is an algorithm that approximately solves a nonlinear minimization problem by solving a sequence of linearized (quadratic) minimization problems of the form \$\$\textbackslash min\_\textbackslash bf x F[\textbackslash bf x] = \^1\o ver2\textbackslash bf x\^\textbackslash rm T \textbackslash bf A \textbackslash bf x - \textbackslash bf b\^\textbackslash rm T \textbackslash bf x + c,\$\$ where x is the control vector, A is a symmetric positive-definite matrix, b is a vector containing data and prior information, and c is a constant. This paper proposes a family of limited-memory preconditioners (LMPs) for accelerating the convergence of conjugate-gradient (CG) methods used to solve quadratic minimization problems such as those encountered in incremental 4D-Var. The family is constructed from a set of vectors si : i = 1, \ldots, l, where each si is assumed to be conjugate with respect to the (Hessian) matrix A. In incremental 4D-Var, approximate LMPs from this family can be built using conjugate vectors generated during the CG minimization on previous outer iterations. The spectral and quasi-Newton LMPs employed in many operational 4D-Var systems are shown to be special cases of the family of LMPs proposed here. In addition, a new LMP based on Ritz vectors (approximate eigenvectors) is derived. The Ritz LMP can be interpreted as a stabilized version of the spectral LMP. Numerical experiments performed with a realistic global ocean 4D-Var system are presented, to test the impact of the three different preconditioners. The Ritz LMP is shown to be more effective than, or at least as effective as, the spectral and quasi-Newton LMPs in our 4D-Var experiments. Our experiments also demonstrate the importance of limiting the number of CG (inner) iterations on certain outer iterations to avoid possible divergence of the cost function on the outer loop. The optimal number of CG iterations will depend on the specific preconditioner used, and can be computed a priori, albeit at the expense of several evaluations of the cost function on the outer loop. In a cycled 4D-Var system, it may be necessary to perform this computation periodically to account for changes in the Hessian matrix arising from changes in the observing system and background-flow field.

Several methods, including Monte Carlo (MC) expectation maximization, MC likelihood ratios, direct MC integra-tion, and particle  lter likelihoods, are inef  cient for the motivating problem of stage-structured population dynamics models in experimen-tal settings. An MC kernel likelihood (MCKL) method is presented that estimates classical likelihoods up to a constant by weighted kernel density estimates of Bayesian posteriors. MCKL is derived by using Bayesian posteriors as importance sampling densities for unnormalized kernel smoothing integrals. MC error and mode bias due to kernel smoothing are discussed and two methods for reducing mode bias are proposed: ``zooming in '' on the maximum likelihood parameters using a focused prior based on an initial estimate and using a posterior cumulant-based approximation of mode bias. A simulated example shows that MCKL can be much more ef  cient than previous approaches for the population dynamics problem. The zooming-in and cumulant-based corrections are illustrated with a multivariate variance estimation problem for which accurate results are obtained even in 20 parameter dimensions.},

In particular, the robust control problem and the average control problem are considered for a tracking type cost functional with an additional penalty on the variance of the state. The expressions for the gradient and Hessian corresponding to either problem contain expected value operators. Due to the large number of uncertainties considered in our model, we suggest to evaluate these expectations using a multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) method. Under mild assumptions, it is shown that this results in the gradient and Hessian corresponding to the MLMC estimator of the original cost functional. Furthermore, we show that the use of certain correlated samples yields a reduction in the total number of samples required. Two optimization methods are investigated: the nonlinear conjugate gradient method and the Newton method. For both, a specific algorithm is provided that dynamically decides which and how many samples should be taken in each iteration. The cost of the optimization up to some specified tolerance \$\textbackslash tau\$ is shown to be proportional to the cost of a gradient evaluation with requested root mean square error \$\textbackslash tau\$. The algorithms are tested on a model elliptic diffusion problem with lognormal diffusion coefficient. An additional nonlinear term is also considered.},

  abstract = {Over the last 20-30 years, the extended Kalman filter (EKF) has become the algorithm of choice in numerous nonlinear estimation and machine learning applications. These include estimating the state of a nonlinear dynamic system as well estimating parameters for nonlinear system identification (eg, learning the weights of a neural network). The EKF applies the standard linear Kalman filter methodology to a linearization of the true nonlinear system. This approach is sub-optimal, and can easily lead to divergence. Julier et al. (1997), proposed the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) as a derivative-free alternative to the extended Kalman filter in the framework of state estimation. This was extended to parameter estimation by Wan and Van der Merwe et al., (2000). The UKF consistently outperforms the EKF in terms of prediction and estimation error, at an equal computational complexity of (OL/sup 3/)/sup l/ for general state-space problems. When the EKF is applied to parameter estimation, the special form of the state-space equations allows for an O(L/sup 2/) implementation. This paper introduces the square-root unscented Kalman filter (SR-UKF) which is also O(L/sup 3/) for general state estimation and O(L/sup 2/) for parameter estimation (note the original formulation of the UKF for parameter-estimation was O(L/sup 3/)). In addition, the square-root forms have the added benefit of numerical stability and guaranteed positive semi-definiteness of the state covariances.},

  abstract = {We consider the problem of maximizing a real-valued continuous function f using a Bayesian approach. Since the early work of Jonas Mockus and Antanas Z\textasciicaron{} ilinskas in the 70's, the problem of optimization is usually formulated by considering the loss function max f - Mn (where Mn denotes the best function value observed after n evaluations of f ). This loss function puts emphasis on the value of the maximum, at the expense of the location of the maximizer. In the special case of a one-step Bayes-optimal strategy, it leads to the classical Expected Improvement (EI) sampling criterion. This is a special case of a Stepwise Uncertainty Reduction (SUR) strategy, where the risk associated to a certain uncertainty measure (here, the expected loss) on the quantity of interest is minimized at each step of the algorithm. In this article, assuming that f is defined over a measure space (X, {$\lambda$}), we propose to consider instead the integral loss function X( f - Mn)+ d{$\lambda$}, and we show that this leads, in the case of a Gaussian process prior, to a new numerically tractable sampling criterion that we call EI2 (for Expected Integrated Expected Improvement). A numerical experiment illustrates that a SUR strategy based on this new sampling criterion reduces the error on both the value and the location of the maximizer faster than the EI-based strategy.},

We show how previously intractable problems in robustness studies can be overcome using emulation techniques, and how these methods allow other scientists to quickly extract approximations to posterior results corresponding to their own particular subjective specification.

  abstract = {In many global optimization problems motivated by engineering applications, the number of function evaluations is severely limited by time or cost. To ensure that each evaluation contributes to the localization of good candidates for the role of global minimizer, a sequential choice of evaluation points is usually carried out. In particular, when Kriging is used to interpolate past evaluations, the uncertainty associated with the lack of information on the function can be expressed and used to compute a number of criteria accounting for the interest of an additional evaluation at any given point. This paper introduces minimizer entropy as a new Kriging-based criterion for the sequential choice of points at which the function should be evaluated. Based on stepwise uncertainty reduction, it accounts for the informational gain on the minimizer expected from a new evaluation. The criterion is approximated using conditional simulations of the Gaussian process model behind Kriging, and then inserted into an algorithm similar in spirit to the Efficient Global Optimization (EGO) algorithm. An empirical comparison is carried out between our criterion and expected improvement, one of the reference criteria in the literature. Experimental results indicate major evaluation savings over EGO. Finally, the method, which we call IAGO (for Informational Approach to Global Optimization) is extended to robust optimization problems, where both the factors to be tuned and the function evaluations are corrupted by noise.},

It involves several steps, including initial sampling, regression and adaptive sampling. This study evaluates an adaptive surrogate modeling based optimization (ASMO) method on two benchmark problems: the Hartman function and calibration of the SAC-SMA hydrologic model. Our results show that: 1) Gaussian Processes are the best surrogate model construction method. A minimum Interpolation Surface method is the best adaptive sampling method. Low discrepancy Quasi Monte Carlo methods are the most suitable initial sampling designs. Some 15\textendash 20 times the dimension of the problem may be the proper initial sample size; 2) The ASMO method is much more efficient than the widely used Shuffled Complex Evolution global optimization method. However, ASMO can provide only approximate optimal solutions, whose precision is limited by surrogate modeling methods and problem-specific features; and 3) The identifiability of model parameters is correlated with parameter sensitivity.},

Both rely on a compelling information-theoretic motivation, and maximize the information gained about the \$\textbackslash arg\textbackslash max\$ of the unknown function; yet, both are plagued by the expensive computation for estimating entropies. We propose a new criterion, Max-value Entropy Search (MES), that instead uses the information about the maximum function value. We show relations of MES to other Bayesian optimization methods, and establish a regret bound. We observe that MES maintains or improves the good empirical performance of ES/PES, while tremendously lightening the computational burden. In particular, MES is much more robust to the number of samples used for computing the entropy, and hence more efficient for higher dimensional problems.},

  abstract = {Bayesian Optimization or Efficient Global Optimization (EGO) is a global search strategy that is designed for expensive black-box functions. In this algorithm, a statistical model (usually the Gaussian process model) is constructed on some initial data samples. The global optimum is approached by iteratively maximizing a so-called acquisition function, that balances the exploration and exploitation effect of the search. The performance of such an algorithm is largely affected by the choice of the acquisition function. Inspired by the usage of higher moments from the Gaussian process model, it is proposed to construct a novel acquisition function based on the moment-generating function (MGF) of the improvement, which is the stochastic gain over the current best fitness value by sampling at an unknown point. This MGF-based acquisition function takes all the higher moments into account and introduces an additional real-valued parameter to control the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. The motivation, rationale and closed-form expression of the proposed function are discussed in detail. In addition, we also illustrate its advantage over other acquisition functions, especially the so-called generalized expected improvement.},

  abstract = {We consider the problem of global optimization of an unknown non-convex smooth function with zeroth-order feedback. In this setup, an algorithm is allowed to adaptively query the underlying function at different locations and receives noisy evaluations of function values at the queried points (i.e. the algorithm has access to zeroth-order information). Optimization performance is evaluated by the expected difference of function values at the estimated optimum and the true optimum. In contrast to the classical optimization setup, first-order information like gradients are not directly accessible to the optimization algorithm. We show that the classical minimax framework of analysis, which roughly characterizes the worst-case query complexity of an optimization algorithm in this setting, leads to excessively pessimistic results. We propose a local minimax framework to study the fundamental difficulty of optimizing smooth functions with adaptive function evaluations, which provides a refined picture of the intrinsic difficulty of zeroth-order optimization. We show that for functions with fast level set growth around the global minimum, carefully designed optimization algorithms can identify a near global minimizer with many fewer queries. For the special case of strongly convex and smooth functions, our implied convergence rates match the ones developed for zeroth-order convex optimization problems [1, 22]. At the other end of the spectrum, for worst-case smooth functions no algorithm can converge faster than the minimax rate of estimating the entire unknown function in the {$\mathscr{l}$}8-norm. We provide an intuitive and efficient algorithm that attains the derived upper error bounds. Finally, using the local minimax framework we are able to clearly dichotomize adaptive and non-adaptive algorithms by showing that non-adaptive algorithms, although optimal in a global minimax sense, do not attain the optimal local minimax rate.},

An important part of this transformation is a balance operator which effectively establishes the multivariate component of the error covariances. The use of this technique in ocean data assimilation is less common. This paper describes a balance operator that can be used in a variable transformation for oceanographic applications of three- and four-dimensional variational assimilation. The proposed balance operator has been implemented in an incremental variational data assimilation system for a global ocean general circulation model. Evidence that the balance operator can explain a significant percentage of background-error variance is presented. The multivariate analysis structures implied by the balance operator are illustrated using single observation experiments.},

The ADMM updates consist of a proximity operator, a least squares regression that includes a big matrix inversion, and an explicit solution for updating the dual variables. Typically, inner loops are required to solve the first two sub-minimization problems due to the intractability of the prior and the matrix inversion. To avoid such drawbacks or limitations, we propose an inner-loop free update rule with two pre-trained deep convolutional architectures. More specifically, we learn a conditional denoising auto-encoder which imposes an implicit data-dependent prior/regularization on ground-truth in the first sub-minimization problem. This design follows an empirical Bayesian strategy, leading to so-called amortized inference. For matrix inversion in the second sub-problem, we learn a convolutional neural network to approximate the matrix inversion, i.e., the inverse mapping is learned by feeding the input through the learned forward network. Note that training this neural network does not require ground-truth or measurements, i.e., it is data-independent. Extensive experiments on both synthetic data and real datasets demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method compared with the conventional ADMM solution using inner loops for solving inverse problems.},

The information\textendash theoretical twins of the components uncertainty, resolution, and reliability provide diagnostic information about the quality of forecasts.

This estimation procedure is shown to enjoy excellent rates of convergence and can be straightforwardly implemented with existing software.

  abstract = {Coastal flooding drives considerable risks to many communities, but projections of future flood risks are deeply uncertain. The paucity of observations of extreme events often motivates the use of statistical approaches to model the distribution of extreme storm surge events. One key deep uncertainty that is often overlooked is model structural uncertainty. There is currently no strong consensus among experts regarding which class of statistical model to use as a `best practice'. Robust management of coastal flooding risks requires coastal managers to consider the distinct possibility of non-stationarity in storm surges. This increases the complexity of the potential models to use, which tends to increase the data required to constrain the model. Here, we use a Bayesian model averaging approach to analyze the balance between (i) model complexity sufficient to capture decision-relevant risks and (ii) data availability to constrain complex model structures. We characterize deep model structural uncertainty through a set of calibration experiments. Specifically, we calibrate a set of models ranging in complexity using long-term tide gauge observations from the Netherlands and the United States. We find that in both considered cases, roughly half of the model weight is associated with the non-stationary models. Our approach provides a formal framework to integrate information across model structures, in light of the potentially sizable modeling uncertainties. By combining information from multiple models, our inference sharpens for the projected storm surge 100 year return levels, and estimated return levels increase by several centimeters. We assess the impacts of data availability through a set of experiments with temporal subsets and model comparison metrics. Our analysis suggests that about 70 years of data are required to stabilize estimates of the 100 year return level, for the locations and methods considered here.},

In particular, we develop a novel Bayesian optimization algorithm, the derivative-enabled knowledgegradient (d-KG), which is one-step Bayes-optimal, asymptotically consistent, and provides greater one-step value of information than in the derivative-free setting. d-KG accommodates noisy and incomplete derivative information, comes in both sequential and batch forms, and can optionally reduce the computational cost of inference through automatically selected retention of a single directional derivative. We also compute the d-KG acquisition function and its gradient using a novel fast discretization-free technique. We show d-KG provides state-of-the-art performance compared to a wide range of optimization procedures with and without gradients, on benchmarks including logistic regression, deep learning, kernel learning, and k-nearest neighbors.},

  abstract = {In nuclear reactor system design and safety analysis, the Best Estimate plus Uncertainty (BEPU) methodology requires that computer model output uncertainties must be quantified in order to prove that the investigated design stays within acceptance criteria. "Expert opinion" and "user self-evaluation" have been widely used to specify computer model input uncertainties in previous uncertainty, sensitivity and validation studies. Inverse Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is the process to inversely quantify input uncertainties based on experimental data in order to more precisely quantify such ad-hoc specifications of the input uncertainty information. In this paper, we used Bayesian analysis to establish the inverse UQ formulation, with systematic and rigorously derived metamodels constructed by Gaussian Process (GP). Due to incomplete or inaccurate underlying physics, as well as numerical approximation errors, computer models always have discrepancy/bias in representing the realities, which can cause over-fitting if neglected in the inverse UQ process. The model discrepancy term is accounted for in our formulation through the "model updating equation". We provided a detailed introduction and comparison of the full and modular Bayesian approaches for inverse UQ, as well as pointed out their limitations when extrapolated to the validation/prediction domain. Finally, we proposed an improved modular Bayesian approach that can avoid extrapolating the model discrepancy that is learnt from the inverse UQ domain to the validation/prediction domain.},

  pages = {11},
  abstract = {Expected improvement and other acquisition functions widely used in Bayesian optimization use a ``one-step'' assumption: they value objective function evaluations assuming no future evaluations will be performed. Because we usually evaluate over multiple steps, this assumption may leave substantial room for improvement. Existing theory gives acquisition functions looking multiple steps in the future but calculating them requires solving a high-dimensional continuous-state continuousaction Markov decision process (MDP). Fast exact solutions of this MDP remain out of reach of today's methods. As a result, previous two- and multi-step lookahead Bayesian optimization algorithms are either too expensive to implement in most practical settings or resort to heuristics that may fail to fully realize the promise of two-step lookahead. This paper proposes a computationally efficient algorithm that provides an accurate solution to the two-step lookahead Bayesian optimization problem in seconds to at most several minutes of computation per batch of evaluations. The resulting acquisition function provides increased query efficiency and robustness compared with previous two- and multi-step lookahead methods in both single-threaded and batch experiments. This unlocks the value of two-step lookahead in practice. We demonstrate the value of our algorithm with extensive experiments on synthetic test functions and real-world problems.},

In this Bayesian framework, the Bayesian neural network (BNN) combined with a PINN for PDEs serves as the prior while the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) or the variational inference (VI) could serve as an estimator of the posterior. B-PINNs make use of both physical laws and scattered noisy measurements to provide predictions and quantify the aleatoric uncertainty arising from the noisy data in the Bayesian framework. Compared with PINNs, in addition to uncertainty quantification, B-PINNs obtain more accurate predictions in scenarios with large noise due to their capability of avoiding overfitting. We conduct a systematic comparison between the two different approaches for the B-PINNs posterior estimation (i.e., HMC or VI), along with dropout used for quantifying uncertainty in deep neural networks. Our experiments show that HMC is more suitable than VI with mean field Gaussian approximation for the B-PINNs posterior estimation, while dropout employed in PINNs can hardly provide accurate predictions with reasonable uncertainty. Finally, we replace the BNN in the prior with a truncated Karhunen-Lo\`eve (KL) expansion combined with HMC or a deep normalizing flow (DNF) model as posterior estimators. The KL is as accurate as BNN and much faster but this framework cannot be easily extended to high-dimensional problems unlike the BNN based framework.},

In contrast to the conventional 4DVAR schemes, the method does not require development of the tangent linear and adjoint codes for implementation. The proposed R4DVAR technique is based on minimization of the cost function in a sequence of low-dimensional subspaces of the control space. Performance of the method is demonstrated in a series of twin-data assimilation experiments into a nonlinear quasigeostrophic model utilized as a strong constraint. When the adjoint code is stable, R4DVAR's convergence rate is comparable to that of the standard 4DVAR algorithm. In the presence of strong instabilities in the direct model, R4DVAR works better than 4DVAR whose performance is deteriorated because of the breakdown of the tangent linear approximation. Comparison of the 4DVAR and R4DVAR also shows that R4DVAR becomes advantageous when observations are sparse and noisy.},

In this work we focus on the rollout approximation for solving the intractable DP. We first prove the improving nature of rollout in tackling lookahead BO and provide a sufficient condition for the used heuristic to be rollout improving. We then provide both a theoretical and practical guideline to decide on the rolling horizon stagewise. This guideline is built on quantifying the negative effect of a mis-specified model. To illustrate our idea, we provide case studies on both single and multi-information source BO. Empirical results show the advantageous properties of our method over several myopic and non-myopic BO algorithms.},

A decoupled approach is proposed in this paper to un-nest the robustness-based design from the analysis of non-design epistemic variables to achieve computational efficiency. The proposed methods are illustrated for the upper stage design problem of a two-stage-toorbit (TSTO) vehicle, where the information on the random design inputs are only available as sparse point and/or interval data. As collecting more data reduces uncertainty but increases cost, the effect of sample size on the optimality and robustness of the solution is also studied. A method is developed to determine the optimal sample size for sparse point data that leads to the solutions of the design problem that are least sensitive to variations in the input random variables.},

Flow reconstruction from sparse data is achieved through the application of a nudging data assimilation technique. It involves the introduction of a feedback control term in the momentum equations which allows us to drive URANS predictions towards reference data, which are here extracted from a direct numerical simulation. Such a data assimilation approach induces negligible supplementary computational cost compared with that of a standard URANS simulation. The influence of the spatial resolution of the reference data on the reconstruction performances is systematically investigated. Using a spacing of the order of one cylinder length between data points, we already observe synchronisation of the low-frequency vortex shedding between the full reference flow and the one that is estimated by URANS. The present data assimilation procedure allows us to compensate for deficiencies in standard URANS calculations and leads to a significant decrease in temporal and spectral errors as computed by spectral proper orthogonal decomposition. Furthermore, high accuracy in terms of mean-flow prediction by URANS is achieved. When considering spacings between measurements that are of the order of the wavelength of the Kelvin\textendash Helmholtz vortices, such phenomena in the shear layers at the top and bottom of the cylinder are correctly estimated, while they are not self-sustained in standard URANS. The influence of the structure of the feedback control term in the data assimilation procedure is also investigated.},

  abstract = {Constraining geophysical models with observed data usually involves solving nonlinear and nonunique inverse problems. Neural mixture density networks (MDNs) provide an efficient way to estimate Bayesian posterior marginal probability density functions (pdf's) that represent the nonunique solution. However, it is difficult to infer correlations between parameters using MDNs, and in turn to draw samples from the posterior pdf. We introduce an alternative to resolve these issues: invertible neural networks (INNs). These are simultaneously trained to represent uncertain forward functions and to solve Bayesian inverse problems. In its usual form, the method does not account for uncertainty caused by data noise and becomes less effective in high dimensionality. To overcome these issues, in this study, we include data uncertainties as additional model parameters, and train the network by maximizing the likelihood of the data used for training. We apply the method to two types of imaging problems: One-dimensional surface wave dispersion inversion and two-dimensional travel time tomography, and we compare the results to those obtained using Monte Carlo and MDNs. Results show that INNs provide comparable posterior pdfs to those obtained using Monte Carlo, including correlations between parameters, and provide more accurate marginal distributions than MDNs. After training, INNs estimate posterior pdfs in seconds on a typical desktop computer. Hence they can be used to provide efficient solutions for repeated inverse problems using different data sets. Also even accounting for training time, our results show that INNs can be more efficient than Monte Carlo methods for solving inverse problems only once.},

  abstract = {The forward model solution and its functional (e.g., the cost function in 4DVAR) are discontinuous with respect to the model's control variables if the model contains discontinuous physical processes that occur during the assimilation window. In such a case, the tangent linear model (the first-order approximation of a finite perturbation) is unable to represent the sharp jumps of the nonlinear model solution. Also, the first order approximation provided by the adjoint model is unable to represent a finite perturbation of the cost function when the introduced perturbation in the control variables crosses discontinuous points. Using an idealized simple model and the Arakawa-Schubert cumulus parameterization scheme, the authors examined the behavior of a cost function and its gradient obtained by the adjoint model with discontinuous model physics. Numerical results show that a cost function involving discontinuous physical processes is zerothorder discontinuous, but piecewise differentiable. The maximum possible number of involved discontinuity points of a cost function increases exponentially as 2kn, where k is the total number of thresholds associated with on-off switches, and n is the total number of time steps in the assimilation window. A backward adjoint model integration with the proper forcings added at various time steps, similar to the backward adjoint model integration that provides the gradient of the cost function at a continuous point, produces a one-sided gradient (called a subgradient and denoted as {$\nabla$}sJ) at a discontinuous point. An accuracy check of the gradient shows that the adjoint-calculated gradient is computed exactly on either side of a discontinuous surface. While a cost function evaluated using a small interval in the control variable space oscillates, the distribution of the gradient calculated at the same resolution not only shows a rather smooth variation, but also is consistent with the general convexity of the original cost function. The gradients of discontinuous cost functions are observed roughly smooth since the adjoint integration correctly computes the one-sided gradient at either side of discontinuous surface. This implies that, although ({$\nabla$}sJ)T{$\delta$}x may not approximate {$\delta$}J = J(x + {$\delta$}x) - J(x) well near the discontinuous surface, the subgradient calculated by the adjoint of discontinuous physics may still provide useful information for finding the search directions in a minimization procedure. While not eliminating the possible need for the use of a nondifferentiable optimization algorithm for 4DVAR with discontinuous physics, consistency between the computed gradient by adjoints and the convexity of the cost function may explain why a differentiable limited-memory quasi-Newton algorithm still worked well in many 4DVAR experiments that use a diabatic assimilation model with discontinuous physics.},

  abstract = {We developed a Nonlinear Level-set Learning (NLL) method for dimensionality reduction in high-dimensional function approximation with small data. This work is motivated by a variety of design tasks in real-world engineering applications, where practitioners would replace their computationally intensive physical models (e.g., high-resolution fluid simulators) with fast-to-evaluate predictive machine learning models, so as to accelerate the engineering design processes. There are two major challenges in constructing such predictive models: (a) high-dimensional inputs (e.g., many independent design parameters) and (b) small training data, generated by running extremely time-consuming simulations. Thus, reducing the input dimension is critical to alleviate the over-fitting issue caused by data insufficiency. Existing methods, including sliced inverse regression and active subspace approaches, reduce the input dimension by learning a linear coordinate transformation; our main contribution is to extend the transformation approach to a nonlinear regime. Specifically, we exploit reversible networks (RevNets) to learn nonlinear level sets of a high-dimensional function and parameterize its level sets in low-dimensional spaces. A new loss function was designed to utilize samples of the target functions' gradient to encourage the transformed function to be sensitive to only a few transformed coordinates. The NLL approach is demonstrated by applying it to three 2D functions and two 20D functions for showing the improved approximation accuracy with the use of nonlinear transformation, as well as to an 8D composite material design problem for optimizing the buckling-resistance performance of composite shells of rocket inter-stages.},

  abstract = {Gibbs sampling is a workhorse for Bayesian inference but has several limitations when used for parameter estimation, and is often much slower than non-sampling inference methods. SAME (State Augmentation for Marginal Estimation) \textbackslash cite\{Doucet99,Doucet02\} is an approach to MAP parameter estimation which gives improved parameter estimates over direct Gibbs sampling. SAME can be viewed as cooling the posterior parameter distribution and allows annealed search for the MAP parameters, often yielding very high quality (lower loss) estimates. But it does so at the expense of additional samples per iteration and generally slower performance. On the other hand, SAME dramatically increases the parallelism in the sampling schedule, and is an excellent match for modern (SIMD) hardware. In this paper we explore the application of SAME to graphical model inference on modern hardware. We show that combining SAME with factored sample representation (or approximation) gives throughput competitive with the fastest symbolic methods, but with potentially better quality. We describe experiments on Latent Dirichlet Allocation, achieving speeds similar to the fastest reported methods (online Variational Bayes) and lower cross-validated loss than other LDA implementations. The method is simple to implement and should be applicable to many other models.},

  abstract = {The traditional activity of model selection aims at discovering a single model superior to other candidate models. In the presence of pronounced noise, however, multiple models are often found to explain the same data equally well. To resolve this model selection ambiguity, we introduce the general approach of model selection confidence sets (MSCSs) based on likelihood ratio testing. A MSCS is defined as a list of models statistically indistinguishable from the true model at a user-specified level of confidence, which extends the familiar notion of confidence intervals to the model-selection framework. Our approach guarantees asymptotically correct coverage probability of the true model when both sample size and model dimension increase. We derive conditions under which the MSCS contains all the relevant information about the true model structure. In addition, we propose natural statistics based on the MSCS to measure importance of variables in a principled way that accounts for the overall model uncertainty. When the space of feasible models is large, MSCS is implemented by an adaptive stochastic search algorithm which samples MSCS models with high probability. The MSCS methodology is illustrated through numerical experiments on synthetic data and real data examples.},

In this paper, the uncertainties in both product design variables and environmental noise variables are considered. The reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) is integrated with robust product design (RPD) to concurrently reduce the production cost and the long-term operation cost, including quality loss, in the process of product design. This problem leads to a multi-objective optimization with probabilistic constraints. In addition, the model uncertainties associated with a surrogate model that is derived from numerical computation methods, such as finite element analysis, is addressed. A hierarchical experimental design approach, augmented by a sequential sampling strategy, is proposed to construct the response surface of product performance function for finding optimal design solutions. The proposed method is demonstrated through an engineering example.},

  abstract = {Abstract A preconditioning method suitable for use in four-dimensional variational (4DVAR) data assimilation is proposed. The method is a generalization of the preconditioning previously developed by the author, now designed to include direct observations, as well as different forms of the cost function. The original approach was based on an estimate of the ratio of the expected decrease of the cost function and of the gradient norm, derived from an approximate Taylor series expansion of the cost function. The generalized method employs only basic linear functional analysis, still preserving the efficiency of the original method. The preconditioning is tested in a realistic 4DVAR assimilation environment: the data are direct observations operationally used at the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (formerly the National Meteorological Center), the forecast model is a full-physics regional eta model, and the adjoint model includes all physics, except radiation. The results of five 4DVAR data assimilation experiments, using a memoryless quasi-Newton minimization algorithm, show a significant benefit of the new preconditioning. On average, the minimization algorithm converges in about 20\textendash 25 iterations. In particular, after only 10 iterations, about 95\% of the cost function decrease was achieved in all five cases. Especially encouraging is the fact that these results are obtained with physical processes present in the adjoint model.},
