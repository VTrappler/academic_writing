  pages = {38},
  abstract = {In many engineering optimization problems, the number of function evaluations is severely limited by time or cost. These problems pose a special challenge to the field of global optimization, since existing methods often require more function evaluations than can be comfortably afforded. One way to address this challenge is to fit response surfaces to data collected by evaluating the objective and constraint functions at a few points. These surfaces can then be used for visualization, tradeoff analysis, and optimization. In this paper, we introduce the reader to a response surface methodology that is especially good at modeling the nonlinear, multimodal functions that often occur in engineering. We then show how these approximating functions can be used to construct an efficient global optimization algorithm with a credible stopping rule. The key to using response surfaces for global optimization lies in balancing the need to exploit the approximating surface (by sampling where it is minimized) with the need to improve the approximation (by sampling where prediction error may be high). Striking this balance requires solving certain auxiliary problems which have previously been considered intractable, but we show how these computational obstacles can be overcome.},

  abstract = {In min-min optimization or max-min optimization, one has to compute the gradient of a function defined as a minimum. In most cases, the minimum has no closed-form, and an approximation is obtained via an iterative algorithm. There are two usual ways of estimating the gradient of the function: using either an analytic formula obtained by assuming exactness of the approximation, or automatic differentiation through the algorithm. In this paper, we study the asymptotic error made by these estimators as a function of the optimization error. We find that the error of the automatic estimator is close to the square of the error of the analytic estimator, reflecting a super-efficiency phenomenon. The convergence of the automatic estimator greatly depends on the convergence of the Jacobian of the algorithm. We analyze it for gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent and derive convergence rates for the estimators in these cases. Our analysis is backed by numerical experiments on toy problems and on Wasserstein barycenter computation. Finally, we discuss the computational complexity of these estimators and give practical guidelines to chose between them.},

Structure present in these problems allows efficient optimization strategies \textemdash{} a well known example is variable projection, where nonlinear least squares problems which are linear in some parameters can be very efficiently optimized. In this paper, we extend the idea of projecting out a subset over the variables to a broad class of maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum a posteriori likelihood (MAP) problems with nuisance parameters, such as variance or degrees of freedom. As a result, we are able to incorporate nuisance parameter estimation into large-scale constrained and unconstrained inverse problem formulations. We apply the approach to a variety of problems, including estimation of unknown variance parameters in the Gaussian model, degree of freedom (d.o.f.) parameter estimation in the context of robust inverse problems, automatic calibration, and optimal experimental design. Using numerical examples, we demonstrate improvement in recovery of primary parameters for several largescale inverse problems. The proposed approach is compatible with a wide variety of algorithms and formulations, and its implementation requires only minor modifications to existing algorithms.},

We show strong consistency of the posterior in regression models with a diverging number of parameters, providing a template to be used for other priors in similar settings. Bayesian computation is straightforward via a simple Gibbs sampling algorithm. We also investigate the properties of the maximum a posteriori estimator and reveal connections with some well-established regularization procedures.

Minimizations required by implicit particle methods are shown to be similar to those that one encounters in variational data assimilation, and the connection of implicit particle methods with variational data assimilation is explored. In particular, it is argued that existing variational codes can be converted into implicit particle methods at a low additional cost, often yielding better estimates that are also equipped with quantitative measures of the uncertainty.

The basic idea is to express the failure probability as a product of larger conditional failure probabilities by introducing intermediate failure events. With a proper choice of the conditional events, the conditional failure probabilities can be made suf\textregistered ciently large so that they can be estimated by means of simulation with a small number of samples. The original problem of calculating a small failure probability, which is computationally demanding, is reduced to calculating a sequence of conditional probabilities, which can be readily and ef\textregistered ciently estimated by means of simulation. The conditional probabilities cannot be estimated ef\textregistered ciently by a standard Monte Carlo procedure, however, and so a Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) technique based on the Metropolis algorithm is presented for their estimation. The proposed method is robust to the number of uncertain parameters and ef\textregistered cient in computing small probabilities. The ef\textregistered ciency of the method is demonstrated by calculating the \textregistered rst-excursion probabilities for a linear oscillator subjected to white noise excitation and for a \textregistered ve-story nonlinear hysteretic shear building under uncertain seismic excitation. q 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

  abstract = {In the past 10 years a statistical technique, approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), has been developed that can be used to infer parameters and choose between models in the complicated scenarios that are often considered in the environmental sciences. For example, based on gene sequence and microsatellite data, the method has been used to choose between competing models of human demographic history as well as to infer growth rates, times of divergence, and other parameters. The method fits naturally in the Bayesian inferential framework, and a brief overview is given of the key concepts. Three main approaches to ABC have been developed, and these are described and compared. Although the method arose in population genetics, ABC is increasingly used in other fields, including epidemiology, systems biology, ecology, and agent-based modeling, and many of these applications are briefly described.},

Mech. 2001) and our sequential Bayesian approach for the estimation of a probability of failure (Bect, Ginsbourger, Li, Picheny and Vazquez, Stat. Comput. 2012). This makes it possible to estimate {$\alpha$} when the number of evaluations of f is very limited and {$\alpha$} is very small. The resulting algorithm is called Bayesian subset simulation (BSS). A key idea, as in the subset simulation algorithm, is to estimate the probabilities of a sequence of excursion sets of f above intermediate thresholds, using a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) approach. A Gaussian process prior on f is used to define the sequence of densities targeted by the SMC algorithm, and drive the selection of evaluation points of f to estimate the intermediate probabilities. Adaptive procedures are proposed to determine the intermediate thresholds and the number of evaluations to be carried out at each stage of the algorithm. Numerical experiments illustrate that BSS achieves significant savings in the number of function evaluations with respect to other Monte Carlo approaches.},

In the industrial world, this corresponds to the problem of estimating a probability of failure of a system. When only an expensive-to-simulate model of the system is available, the budget for simulations is usually severely limited and therefore classical Monte Carlo methods ought to be avoided. One of the main contributions of this article is to derive SUR (stepwise uncertainty reduction) strategies from a Bayesian-theoretic formulation of the problem of estimating a probability of failure. These sequential strategies use a Gaussian process model of f and aim at performing evaluations of f as efficiently as possible to infer the value of the probability of failure. We compare these strategies to other strategies also based on a Gaussian process model for estimating a probability of failure.},

This problem is challenging since modeling a complex system under uncertainty can be expensive and for most real-world problems robust optimization will not be computationally viable. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian methodology to efficiently solve a class of robust optimization problems that arise in engineering design under uncertainty. The central idea is to use Gaussian process models of loss functions (or robustness metrics) together with appropriate acquisition functions to guide the search for a robust optimal solution. Numerical studies on a test problem are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.},

  abstract = {The 20th century began on an auspicious statistical note with the publication of Karl Pearson's (Philos. Mag. Ser. 50 (1900) 157) goodness-of-fit test, which is regarded as one of the most important scientific breakthroughs. The basic motivation behind this test was to see whether an assumed probability model adequately described the data at hand. Pearson (Philos. Trans. Roy. Soc. London Ser. A 185 (1894) 71) also introduced a formal approach to statistical estimation through his method of moments (MM) estimation. Ronald A. Fisher, while he was a third year undergraduate at the Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, suggested the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) procedure as an alternative to Pearson's MM approach. In 1922 Fisher published a monumental paper that introduced such basic concepts as consistency, efficiency, sufficiency\textemdash and even the term ``parameter'' with its present meaning. Fisher (Philos. Trans. Roy. Soc. London Ser. A 222 (1922) 309) provided the analytical foundation of MLE and studied its efficiency relative to the MM estimator. Fisher (J. Roy. Statist. Soc. 87 (1924a) 442) established the asymptotic equivalence of minimum {$\chi$}2 and ML estimators and wrote in favor of using minimum {$\chi$}2 method rather than Pearson's MM approach. Recently, econometricians have found working under assumed likelihood functions restrictive, and have suggested using a generalized version of Pearson's MM approach, commonly known as the GMM estimation procedure as advocated in Hansen (Econometrica 50 (1982) 1029). Earlier, Godambe (Ann. Math. Statist. 31 (1960) 1208) and Durbin (J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B 22 (1960) 139) developed the estimating function (EF) approach to estimation that has been proven very useful for many statistical models. A fundamental result is that score is the optimum EF. Ferguson (Ann. Math. Statist. 29 (1958) 1046) considered an approach very similar to GMM and showed that estimation based on the Pearson {$\chi$}2 statistic is equivalent to efficient GMM. Golan et al. (Maximum Entropy Econometrics: Robust Estimation with Limited Data. Wiley, New York, 1996) developed entropy-based formulation that allowed them to solve a wide range of estimation and inference problems in econometrics. More recently, Imbens et al. (Econometrica 66 (1998) 333), Kitamura and Stutzer (Econometrica 65 (1997) 861) and Mittelhammer et al. (Econometric Foundations. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2000) put GMM within the framework of empirical likelihood (EL) and maximum entropy (ME) estimation. It can be shown that many of these estimation techniques can be obtained as special cases of minimizing Cressie and Read (J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B 46 (1984) 440) power divergence criterion that comes directly from the Pearson (1900) {$\chi$}2 statistic. In this way we are able to assimilate a number of seemingly unrelated estimation techniques into a unified framework.},

In this paper, we propose a modification of SAA, which we term Robust SAA, which retains SAA's tractability and asymptotic properties and, additionally, enjoys strong finite-sample performance guarantees. The key to our method is linking SAA, distributionally robust optimization, and hypothesis testing of goodness-of-fit. Beyond Robust SAA, this connection provides a unified perspective enabling us to characterize the finite sample and asymptotic guarantees of various other data-driven procedures that are based upon distributionally robust optimization. This analysis provides insight into the practical performance of these various methods in real applications. We present examples from inventory management and portfolio allocation, and demonstrate numerically that our approach outperforms other data-driven approaches in these applications.},

The properties of the half-sample mode, which is a simple and fast estimator of the mode of a continuous distribution, are studied. The half-sample mode is less sensitive to outliers than most other estimators of location, including many other low-bias estimators of the mode. Its breakdown point is one half, equal to that of the median. However, because of its finite rejection point, the half-sample mode is much less sensitive to outliers that are all either greater or less than the other values of the sample. This is confirmed by applying the mode estimator and the median to samples drawn from normal, lognormal, and Pareto distributions contaminated by outliers. It is also shown that the half-sample mode, in combination with a robust scale estimator, is a highly robust starting point for iterative robust location estimators such as Huber's M-estimator. The half-sample mode can easily be generalized to modal intervals containing more or less than half of the sample. An application of such an estimator to the finding of collision points in high-energy proton-proton interactions is presented.},

The median is often used instead of the mean for asymmetric data because it is closer to the mode and is insensitive to extreme values in the sample. However, the mode itself can be reliably estimated by first transforming the data into approximately normal data by raising the values to a real power, and then estimating the mean and standard deviation of the transformed data. With this method, two estimators of the mode of the original data are proposed: a simple estimator based on estimating the mean by the sample mean and the standard deviation by the sample standard deviation, and a more robust estimator based on estimating the mean by the median and the standard deviation by the standardized median absolute deviation.},

  abstract = {A major challenge in next-generation industrial applications is to improve numerical analysis by quantifying uncertainties in predictions. In this work we present a formulation of a fully nonlinear and dispersive potential flow water wave model with random inputs for the probabilistic description of the evolution of waves. The model is analyzed using random sampling techniques and non-intrusive methods based on generalized Polynomial Chaos (PC). These methods allow to accurately and efficiently estimate the probability distribution of the solution and require only the computation of the solution in different points in the parameter space, allowing for the reuse of existing simulation software. The choice of the applied methods is driven by the number of uncertain input parameters and by the fact that finding the solution of the considered model is computationally intensive. We revisit experimental benchmarks often used for validation of deterministic water wave models. Based on numerical experiments and assumed uncertainties in boundary data, our analysis reveals that some of the known discrepancies from deterministic simulation in comparison with experimental measurements could be partially explained by the variability in the model input. We finally present a synthetic experiment studying the variance based sensitivity of the wave load on an offshore structure to a number of input uncertainties. In the numerical examples presented the PC methods have exhibited fast convergence, suggesting that the problem is amenable to being analyzed with such methods.},

We then develop a lookahead-based sequential design scheme that can determine if a new run should be at an existing input location (i.e., replicate) or at a new one (explore). When paired with a newly developed heteroscedastic Gaussian process model, our dynamic design scheme facilitates learning of signal and noise relationships which can vary throughout the input space. We show that it does so efficiently, on both computational and statistical grounds. In addition to illustrative synthetic examples, we demonstrate performance on two challenging real-data simulation experiments, from inventory management and epidemiology.

We argue that a valid update of a prior belief distribution to a posterior can be made for parameters which are connected to observations through a loss function rather than the traditional likelihood function, which is recovered as a special case. Modern application areas make it increasingly challenging for Bayesians to attempt to model the true data-generating mechanism. For instance, when the object of interest is low dimensional, such as a mean or median, it is cumbersome to have to achieve this via a complete model for the whole data distribution. More importantly, there are settings where the parameter of interest does not directly index a family of density functions and thus the Bayesian approach to learning about such parameters is currently regarded as problematic. Our framework uses loss functions to connect information in the data to functionals of interest. The updating of beliefs then follows from a decision theoretic approach involving cumulative loss functions. Importantly, the procedure coincides with Bayesian updating when a true likelihood is known yet provides coherent subjective inference in much more general settings. Connections to other inference frameworks are highlighted.},

Among these models, Gaussian process regression (kriging) is very efficient see e.g Snelson (2008). In high dimension that is with a large number of input variables , but with few observations the classical anisotropic kriging becomes inefficient and sometimes completely wrong. One way to overcome this drawback is to use the isotropic kernel which is more robust because it estimates not as many parameters. However this model is too restrictive. The aim of this paper is to construct a model between these two, that is at the same time a robust and a flexible model. These two skills are necessary for a model in high dimension. We propose a kernel which is an answer to these requests and that we call isotropic by group kernel. This kernel is a tensor product of few isotropic kernels built on well-chosen subgroup of variables. The number and the composition of the groups are found by an algorithm which explores different structures. The choice of the best model is based on the quality of prediction.},

Our goal is to attempt to understand the stochastic Burgers dynamics by predicting or estimating the solution processes in various diagnostic metrics, such as mean length scale, correlation function and mean energy. First, for the linearized model, we observe that the important statistical quantities like mean energy or correlation functions are the same for the two types of random forcing, even though the solutions behave very differently. Second, for the full nonlinear model, we estimate the mean energy for various types of random body forcing, highlighting the different impact on the overall dynamics of space-time white noises, trace class white-in-time and colored-in-space noises, point noises, additive noises or multiplicative noises.},

  abstract = {Abstract Oceanographic observations are limited by sampling rates, while ocean models are limited by finite resolution and high viscosity and diffusion coefficients. Therefore both data from observations and ocean models lack information at small- and fast-scales. Methods are needed to either extract information, extrapolate, or up-scale existing oceanographic datasets, to account for or represent unresolved physical processes. Here we use machine learning to leverage observations and model data by predicting unresolved turbulent processes and sub-surface flow fields. As a proof-of-concept, we train convolutional neural networks on degraded-data from a high-resolution quasi-geostrophic ocean model. We demonstrate that convolutional neural networks successfully replicate the spatio-temporal variability of the sub-grid eddy momentum forcing, are capable of generalising to a range of dynamical behaviours, and can be forced to respect global momentum conservation. The training data of our convolutional neural networks can be sub-sampled to 10-20\% of the original size without a significant decrease in accuracy. We also show that the sub-surface flow field can be predicted using only information at the surface (e.g., using only satellite altimetry data). Our study indicates that data-driven approaches can be exploited to predict both sub-grid and large-scale processes, while respecting physical principles, even when data is limited to a particular region or external forcing. Our in-depth study presents evidence for the successful design of ocean eddy parameterisations for implementation in coarse-resolution climate models.},

We calibrate the degree of misspecification using a detection error probability approach, which allows us to perform systematic sensitivity analysis in both point-identified and partially-identified settings. We study three examples: demand analysis, treatment effects estimation under selection on observables, and panel data models where the distribution of individual effects may be misspecified and the number of time periods is small.},

Since the manual exploration of the parameter space is tedious -- even for few parameters -- several automatic procedures for parameter tuning have been proposed. Recent approaches also take into account some characteristic properties of the problem instances, frequently termed instance features. Our contribution is the proposal of a novel concept for feature-based algorithm parameter tuning, which applies an approximating surrogate model for learning the continuous feature-parameter mapping. To accomplish this, we learn a joint model of the algorithm performance based on both the algorithm parameters and the instance features. The required data is gathered using a recently proposed acquisition function for model refinement in surrogate-based optimization: the profile expected improvement. This function provides an avenue for maximizing the information required for the feature-parameter mapping, i.e., the mapping from instance features to the corresponding optimal algorithm parameters. The approach is validated by applying the tuner to exemplary evolutionary algorithms and problems, for which theoretically grounded or heuristically determined feature-parameter mappings are available.},

Il s'agit des \'equations Shallow Water. L'objectif de cette th\`ese est de d\'evelopper et d'analyser un algorithme de r\'esolution des \'equations Shallow Water sur une sph\`ere en rotation. Dans un premier temps, j'\'etudie diff\'erents aspects math\'ematiques des op\'erateurs aux diff\'erences finis utilis\'es par la suite en g\'eom\'etrie sph\'erique. Les sch\'emas aux diff\'erences obtenus sont utilis\'es pour r\'esoudre l'\'equation de transport, l'\'equation des ondes et l'\'equation de Burgers. Les propri\'et\'es de stabilit\'e pr\'ecision et conservation sont analys\'ees. Dans un second temps, la grille Cubed-Sphere est introduite et analys\'ee.  La structure de ce maillage est analogue \`a celle d'un cube. L'interpr\'etation de la Cubed-Sphere \`a l'aide de grands cercles permet de construire des op\'erateurs sph\'eriques discrets gradient, divergence et vorticit\'e d'ordre au moins \'egal \`a 3 (en pratique d'ordre 4).  La troisi\`eme partie de la th\`ese est d\'edi\'ee \`a diff\'erents tests pour le syst\`eme d'\'equations Shallow Water ainsi que pour l'\'equation d'advection. Les r\'esultats d\'emontrent une pr\'ecision proche de celle obtenue par les algorithmes conservatifs d'ordre 4 les plus r\'ecents},

The model uses only two factors, depth and velocity, to calculate quality and a third factor, width to quantify utility. The implementations were based on 3 multi-criteria evaluation approaches: Weighted Average, Fuzzy Sets and Bayesian probability. There was broad agreement between the formulations but important differences in detail. The model outputs indicate that uncertainty arising from model formulation is significant and can have a bearing on planning decisions. There is a complex interaction between the formulations and the characteristics of the sites. Suitability models should be used thoughtfully and implemented in ways that: facilitate exploratory analysis; present ranges of possible outputs; present indicators of uncertainty; and facilitate back tracking to explain the outputs.},

It can be considered a continuum-armed-bandit problem, with noiseless data, and simple regret. Expected-improvement algorithms are perhaps the most popular methods for solving the problem; in this paper, we provide theoretical results on their asymptotic behaviour. Implementing these algorithms requires a choice of Gaussian-process prior, which determines an associated space of functions, its reproducing-kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). When the prior is fixed, expected improvement is known to converge on the minimum of any function in its RKHS. We provide convergence rates for this procedure, optimal for functions of low smoothness, and describe a modified algorithm attaining optimal rates for smoother functions.},

We focus particularly on the mixture of distributions problem. In this context, we review the available theoretical results on the convergence of these algorithms and on the behavior of SEM as the sample size tends to infinity. The second part is devoted to intensive Monte Carlo numerical simulations and a real data study. We show that, for some particular mixture situations, the SEM algorithm is almost always preferable to the EM and simulated annealing versions SAEM and MCEM. For some very intricate mixtures, however, none of these algorithms can be confidently used. Then, SEM can be used as an efficient data exploratory tool for locating significant maxima of the likelihood function. In the real data case, we show that the SEM stationary distribution provides a contrasted view of the loglikelihood by emphasizing sensible maxima.},

One is that the different amount of smoothing is allocated by naturally varying kernel shape without explicitly changing the value of the smoothing bandwidth. Another feature is that the support of the beta kernels can match the support of the density function; this leads to larger effective sample sizes used in the density estimation and can produce density estimates that have smaller finite-sample variance than some other estimators.},

  abstract = {In Bayesian inference, a joint posterior distribution is available through the likelihood function and a prior distribution. One purpose of Bayesian inference is to calculate and display marginal posterior densities because the marginal posterior densities provide complete information about parameters of interest. As shown in Chapter 2, a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithm, such as the Gibbs sampler or a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, can be used to draw MCMC samples from the posterior distribution. Chapter 3 also demonstrates how we can easily obtain posterior quantities such as posterior means, posterior standard deviations, and other posterior quantities from MCMC samples. However, when a Bayesian model becomes complicated, it may be difficult to obtain a reliable estimator of a marginal posterior density based on the MCMC sample. A traditional method for estimating marginal posterior densities is kernel density estimation. Since the kernel density estimator is nonparametric, it may not be efficient. On the other hand, the kernel density estimator may not be applicable for some complicated Bayesian models. In the context of Bayesian inference, the joint posterior density is typically known up to a normalizing constant. Using the structure of a posterior density, a number of authors (e.g., Gelfand, Smith, and Lee 1992; Johnson 1992; Chen 1993 and 1994; Chen and Shao 1997c; Chib 1995; Verdinelli and Wasserman 1995) propose parametric marginal posterior density estimators based on the MCMC sample. In this chapter, we present several available Monte Carlo (MC) methods for computing marginal posterior density estimators, and we also discuss how well marginal posterior density estimation works using the Kullback\textemdash Leibler (K\textemdash L) divergence as a performance measure.},

This is a nontrivial extension because it requires a delicate analysis of the entropy of the semiparametric models involved. We find that the accuracy of inferences based on the profile sampler improves as the convergence rate of the nuisance parameter increases. Simulation studies are used to verify this theoretical result. We also establish that an exact frequentist confidence interval obtained by inverting the profile log-likelihood ratio can be estimated with higher-order accuracy by the credible set of the same type obtained from the posterior profile distribution. Our theory is verified for several specific examples.},

For reliability optimization design with uncertain parameters, based on the non-probabilistic reliability theory, robust design and optimal design method, the uncertain parameters of mechanical components are expressed by non-probabilistic interval variables, and a non-probabilistic measure and procedure for robust reliability computation is presented. Compared with the conventional probabilistic reliability optimization approach, the proposed method does not require a presumed probability distribution of the uncertain parameters and only the bounds or ranges of their variations are required. The optimal design for non-probabilistic robust reliability is formulated as a two level optimization problem, in which the first level minimizes the original robust optimal objective with the constraints of non-probabilistic reliability index, and the secondary level is used to identify the reliability index. The purpose of it is to get a tradeoff between the design objective and the robustness to uncertainties and satisfy the requirements for reliability. For instance, the robust reliability optimization of unidirectional wedge-typed overrunning clutch is proposed, and the results show that the proposed method is useful for mechanical components design and quality improvement.},

  abstract = {Formulations of optimization under uncertainty (OUU) commonly used in 
aerospace design\textemdash those based on treating statistical moments of the quantity 
of interest (QOI) as separate objectives\textemdash can result in stochastically dominated 
designs. A stochastically dominated design is undesirable, because it is less likely 
than another design to achieve a QOI at least as good as a given value, for any 
given value. 
 
As a remedy to this limitation for the multi-objective formulation of moments, 
a novel OUU formulation is proposed\textemdash dominance optimization. This formulation 
seeks a set of solutions and makes use of global optimizers, so is useful for early 
stages of the design process when exploration of design space is important. 
 
Similarly, to address this limitation for the single-objective formulation of 
moments (combining moments via a weighted sum), a second novel formulation 
is proposed\textemdash horsetail matching. This formulation can make use of gradient- 
based local optimizers, so is useful for later stages of the design process when 
exploitation of a region of design space is important. Additionally, horsetail 
matching extends straightforwardly to different representations of uncertainty, 
and is flexible enough to emulate several existing OUU formulations. 
 
Existing multi-fidelity methods for OUU are not compatible with these novel 
formulations, so one such method\textemdash information reuse\textemdash is generalized to be 
compatible with these and other formulations. 
 
The proposed formulations, along with generalized information reuse, are 
compared to their most comparable equivalent in the current state-of-the-art 
on practical design problems: transonic aerofoil design, coupled aero-structural 
wing design, high-fidelity 3D wing design, and acoustic horn shape design. 
 
Finally, the two novel formulations are combined in a two-step design process, 
which is used to obtain a robust design in a challenging version of the acoustic horn 
design problem. Dominance optimization is given half the computational budget 
for exploration; then horsetail matching is given the other half for exploitation. 
Using exactly the same computational budget as a moment-based approach, the 
design obtained using the novel formulations is 95\% more likely to achieve a 
better QOI than the best value achievable by the moment-based design.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new approach for optimization under uncertainty in the presence of probabilistic, interval, and mixed uncertainties, avoiding the need to specify probability distributions on uncertain parameters when such information is not readily available. Existing approaches for optimization under these types of uncertainty mostly rely on treating combinations of statistical moments as separate objectives, but this can give rise to stochastically dominated designs. Here, horsetail matching is extended for use with these types of uncertainties to overcome some of the limitations of existing approaches. The formulation delivers a single, differentiable metric as the objective function for optimization. It is demonstrated on algebraic test problems, the design of a wing using a low-fidelity coupled aerostructural code, and the aerodynamic shape optimization of a wing using computational fluid dynamics analysis.},

  abstract = {It is important to design engineering systems to be robust with respect to uncertainties in the design process. Often, this is done by considering statistical moments, but over-reliance on statistical moments when formulating a robust optimization can produce designs that are stochastically dominated by other feasible designs. This article instead proposes a formulation for optimization under uncertainty that minimizes the difference between a design's cumulative distribution function and a target. A standard target is proposed that produces stochastically non-dominated designs, but the formulation also offers enough flexibility to recover existing approaches for robust optimization. A numerical implementation is developed that employs kernels to give a differentiable objective function. The method is applied to algebraic test problems and a robust transonic airfoil design problem where it is compared to multi-objective, weighted-sum and density matching approaches to robust optimization; several advantages over these existing methods are demonstrated.},

  abstract = {Fluvial flooding is a costly problem in the UK and worldwide. Real-time accurate inundation forecasting can help to reduce the damage caused by inundation events by alerting people to take necessary mitigating actions. This work is part of an effort to improve inundation forecasting using data assimilation (DA). DA is a method for combining a numerical model of a system with observations in order to best estimate the current state of the system. A river inundation model has been developed using numerical implementation of the shallow water equations with an inflow source term added; the model and implementation of the source term are described here. The model has then been used with idealised river valley topographies in order to investigate the sensitivities of the system to model parameters describing the effect of friction between water and the river channel, and the effect of the topography slope at the downstream boundary. Initial DA experiments using an ensemble Kalman Filter are also described. Identical twin experiments show that the DA as implemented in this domain can correct the water levels at the time of the observations, and that more observations lead to a better correction. However, by the time of the next observations very similar water levels are predicted, regardless of the number of observations used in the assimilation. This implies that the effective time for observations in this system is small compared to the time between observations.},

The parameters to be estimated (bottom friction coefficient and water depth) are assumed to be position-dependent and are approximated by piecewise linear interpolations between certain nodal values. The numerical scheme consists of a two-level leapfrog method. The adjoint scheme is constructed on the assumption that a certain norm of the difference between computed and observed elevations at the tide gauges should be minimized. It is shown that a satisfactory numerical minimization can be completed using either the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) quasi-Newton algorithm or Nash's truncated Newton algorithm. On the basis of a number of test problems, it is shown that very effective estimation of the nodal values of the parameters can be achieved provided the number of data stations is sufficiently large in relation to the number of nodes.},

In this paper, design is formalized as the optimization of a performance index with respect to control variables. Uncertainty is modeled via a vector of environmental variables that can take any value in a known compact set and may have an adverse effect on performance. In this context, the determination of a robust design requires the continuous minimax optimization of black-box functions. An algorithm combining Kriging-based optimization with relaxation is presented, which makes it possible to find approximate solutions to such problems on a limited computational budget.

In some of these approaches, the idea is that incompleteness makes the likelihood func-tion imprecise. Two proposals can be found to cope with this situation: maximize the maximal likelihood induced by precise datasets compat-ible with the incomplete observations, or maximize the minimal such likelihood. These approaches prove to be extremist, the maximax ap-proach having a tendency to disambiguate the data, while the maximin approach favors uniform distributions. In this paper we propose an al-ternative approach consisting in minimax relative regret criterion with respect to maximal likelihood solutions obtained for all precise datasets compatible with the coarse data. It uses relative likelihood and seems to achieve a trade-off between the maximax and the maximin methods.},

Model selection is a key ingredient in data analysis for reliable and reproducible statistical inference or prediction, and thus central to scientific studies in fields such as ecology, economics, engineering, finance, political science, biology, and epidemiology. There has been a long history of model selection techniques that arise from researches in statistics, information theory, and signal processing. A considerable number of methods have been proposed, following different philosophies and exhibiting varying performances. The purpose of this article is to bring a comprehensive overview of them, in terms of their motivation, large sample performance, and applicability. We provide integrated and practically relevant discussions on theoretical properties of state-ofthe-art model selection approaches.

Apr\`es avoir pr\'ecis\'e diff\'erents cadres d'analyse d'identifiabilit\'e, nous nous int\'eressons plus particuli\`erement \`a l'identifiabilit\'e a posteriori, pour des conditions exp\'erimentales fix\'ees, puis \`a l'identifiabilit\'e pratique, prenant en plus en compte les bruits de mesure. Pour ce dernier cadre, nous proposons une m\'ethodologie d'analyse locale autour de valeurs particuli\`eres des param\`etres. En ce qui concerne l'identifiabilit\'e des param\`etres du mod\`ele dynamique de la phase photocytotoxique de la PDT, nous montrons que parmi les dix param\`etres localement identifiables a posteriori, seulement l'un d'entre eux l'est en pratique. N\'eanmoins, ces r\'esultats locaux demeurent insuffisants en raison des larges plages de variation possibles des param\`etres du mod\`ele et n\'ecessitent d'\^etre compl\'et\'es par une analyse globale. Le manque de m\'ethode visant \`a tester l'identifiabilit\'e globale a posteriori ou pratique, nous a orient\'es vers l'analyse de sensibilit\'e globale de la sortie du mod\`ele par rapport \`a ses param\`etres.

Nous montrons alors que les liens suivants existent : une fonction de sensibilit\'e totale nulle implique un param\`etre non-identifiable; deux fonctions de sensibilit\'e colin\'eaires impliquent la non-identifiabilit\'e mutuelle des param\`etres en question ; la non-injectivit\'e de la sortie par rapport \`a un de ses param\`etres peut aussi entrainer la non-identifiabilit\'e du param\`etre en question mais ce dernier point ne peut \^etre d\'etect\'e en analysant les fonctions de sensibilit\'e uniquement. En somme, la d\'etection des param\`etres non globalement identifiables dans un cadre exp\'erimental donn\'e \`a partir de r\'esultats d'analyse de sensibilit\'e globale ne peut \^etre que partielle.

Starting with the premise that simulation-based approaches are not affordable for such problems, and that the most-probablefailure-point-based approaches do not permit to quantify the error on the estimation of the failure probability, an approach based on both metamodels and advanced simulation techniques is explored. The kriging metamodeling technique is chosen in order to surrogate the performance functions because it allows one to genuinely quantify the surrogate error. The surrogate error onto the limit-state surfaces is propagated to the failure probabilities estimates in order to provide an empirical error measure. This error is then sequentially reduced by means of a populationbased adaptive refinement technique until the kriging surrogates are accurate enough for reliability analysis. This original refinement strategy makes it possible to add several observations in the design of experiments at the same time. Reliability and reliability sensitivity analyses are performed by means of the subset simulation technique for the sake of numerical efficiency. The adaptive surrogate-based strategy for reliability estimation is finally involved into a classical gradient-based optimization algorithm in order to solve the RBDO problem. The kriging surrogates are built in a so-called augmented reliability space thus making them reusable from one nested RBDO iteration to the other. The strategy is compared to other approaches available in the literature on three academic examples in the field of structural mechanics.},

  abstract = {We study the inverse problem of estimating a field \$u\$ from data comprising a finite set of nonlinear functionals of \$u\$, subject to additive noise; we denote this observed data by \$y\$. Our interest is in the reconstruction of piecewise continuous fields in which the discontinuity set is described by a finite number of geometric parameters. Natural applications include groundwater flow and electrical impedance tomography. We take a Bayesian approach, placing a prior distribution on \$u\$ and determining the conditional distribution on \$u\$ given the data \$y\$. It is then natural to study maximum a posterior (MAP) estimators. Recently (Dashti et al 2013) it has been shown that MAP estimators can be characterised as minimisers of a generalised Onsager-Machlup functional, in the case where the prior measure is a Gaussian random field. We extend this theory to a more general class of prior distributions which allows for piecewise continuous fields. Specifically, the prior field is assumed to be piecewise Gaussian with random interfaces between the different Gaussians defined by a finite number of parameters. We also make connections with recent work on MAP estimators for linear problems and possibly non-Gaussian priors (Helin, Burger 2015) which employs the notion of Fomin derivative. In showing applicability of our theory we focus on the groundwater flow and EIT models, though the theory holds more generally. Numerical experiments are implemented for the groundwater flow model, demonstrating the feasibility of determining MAP estimators for these piecewise continuous models, but also that the geometric formulation can lead to multiple nearby (local) MAP estimators. We relate these MAP estimators to the behaviour of output from MCMC samples of the posterior, obtained using a state-of-the-art function space Metropolis-Hastings method.},

The approach is non-intrusive and makes use of discrete sampling based on collocation on simplex elements in stochastic space. Adjoint or dual equations are introduced to estimate errors in statistical moments of random functionals resulting from the inexact reconstruction of the solution within the simplex elements. The approach is demonstrated to be accurate in estimating errors in statistical moments of interest and shown to exhibit super-convergence, in accordance with the underlying theoretical rates. Goal-oriented error indicators are then built using the adjoint solution and exploited to identify regions for adaptive sampling. The error-estimation and adaptive refinement strategy is applied to a range of problems including those governed by algebraic equations as well as scalar and systems of ordinary and partial differential equations. The strategy holds promise as a reliable method to set and achieve error tolerances for efficient aleatory uncertainty quantification in complex problems. Furthermore, the procedure can be combined with numerical error estimates in physical space so as to effectively manage a computational budget to achieve the best possible overall accuracy in the results.},

Cette partie d\'edi\'ee \`a la m\'ethodologie s'ach\`eve par un chapitre consacr\'e \`a l'assimilation de donn\'ees ensemblistes et \`a l'utilisation des mod\`eles r\'eduits dans ce cadre. La quatri\`eme partie de ce manuscrit est d\'edi\'ee aux r\'esultats. On commence par identifier les sources d'incertitudes en hydraulique que l'on s'attache \`a quantifier et r\'eduire par la suite. Un article en cours de r\'evision d\'etaille la validation d'un mod\`ele r\'eduit pour les \'equations de Saint-Venant en r\'egime stationnaire lorsque l'incertitude est majoritairement port\'ee par les coefficients de frottement et le d\'ebit \`a l'amont. On montre que les moments statistiques, la densit\'e de probabilit\'e et la matrice de covariances spatiales pour la hauteur d'eau sont efficacement et pr\'ecis\'ement estim\'es \`a l'aide du mod\`ele r\'eduit dont la construction ne n\'ecessite que quelques dizaines d'int\'egrations du mod\`ele direct. On met \`a profit l'utilisation du mod\`ele r\'eduit pour r\'eduire le co\^ut de calcul du filtre de Kalman d'Ensemble dans le cadre d'un exercice d'assimilation de donn\'ees synth\'etiques de type SWOT. On s'int\'eresse pr\'ecis\'ement \`a la repr\'esentation spatiale de la donn\'ee telle que vue par SWOT: couverture globale du r\'eseau, moyennage spatial entre les pixels observ\'es. On montre notamment qu'\`a budget de calcul donn\'e les r\'esultats de l'analyse d'assimilation de donn\'ees qui repose sur l'utilisation du mod\`ele r\'eduit sont meilleurs que ceux obtenus avec le filtre classique. On s'int\'eresse enfin \`a la construction du mod\`ele r\'eduit en r\'egime instationnaire. On suppose ici que l'incertitude est li\'ee aux coefficients de frottement. Il s'agit \`a pr\'esent de juger de la n\'ecessit\'e du recalcul des coefficients polynomiaux au fil du temps et des cycles d'assimilation de donn\'ees. Pour ce travail seul des donn\'ees in-situ ont \'et\'e consid\'er\'ees. On suppose dans un deuxi\`eme temps que l'incertitude est port\'ee par le d\'ebit en amont du r\'eseau, qui est un vecteur temporel. On proc\`ede \`a une d\'ecomposition de type Karhunen-Lo\`eve pour r\'eduire la taille de l'espace incertain aux trois premiers modes. Nous sommes ainsi en mesure de mener \`a bien un exercice d'assimilation de donn\'ees. Pour finir, les conclusions et les perspectives de ce travail sont pr\'esent\'ees en cinqui\`eme partie.},

  abstract = {In this paper, several formulations for optimization under uncertainty are presented. In addition to the direct nesting of uncertainty quantification within optimization, formulations are presented for surrogate-based optimization under uncertainty in which the surrogate model appears at the optimization level, at the uncertainty quantification level, or at both levels. These surrogate models encompass both data fit and hierarchical surrogates. The DAKOTA software framework is used to provide the foundation for prototyping and initial benchmarking of these formulations. A critical component is the extension of algorithmic techniques for deterministic surrogate-based optimization to these surrogate-based optimization under uncertainty formulations. This involves the use of sequential trust regionbased approaches to manage the extent of the approximations and verify the approximate optima. Two analytic test problems and one engineering problem are solved using the different methodologies in order to compare their relative merits. Results show that surrogate-based optimization under uncertainty formulations show promise both in reducing the number of function evaluations required and in mitigating the effects of nonsmooth response variations.},

  abstract = {A fundamental concern of a theory of statistical inference is how one should measure statistical evidence. Certainly the words ``statistical evidence,'' or perhaps just ``evidence,'' are much used in statistical contexts. It is fair to say, however, that the precise characterization of this concept is somewhat elusive. Our goal here is to provide a definition of how to measure statistical evidence for any particular statistical problem. Since evidence is what causes beliefs to change, it is proposed to measure evidence by the amount beliefs change from a priori to a posteriori. As such, our definition involves prior beliefs and this raises issues of subjectivity versus objectivity in statistical analyses. This is dealt with through a principle requiring the falsifiability of any ingredients to a statistical analysis. These concerns lead to checking for prior-data conflict and measuring the a priori bias in a prior.},

  abstract = {This article addresses the problem of derivative-free (single- or multi-objective) optimization subject to multiple inequality constraints. Both the objective and constraint functions are assumed to be smooth, non-linear and expensive to evaluate. As a consequence, the number of evaluations that can be used to carry out the optimization is very limited, as in complex industrial design optimization problems. The method we propose to overcome this difficulty has its roots in both the Bayesian and the multi-objective optimization literatures. More specifically, an extended domination rule is used to handle objectives and constraints in a unified way, and a corresponding expected hyper-volume improvement sampling criterion is proposed. This new criterion is naturally adapted to the search of a feasible point when none is available, and reduces to existing Bayesian sampling criteria---the classical Expected Improvement (EI) criterion and some of its constrained/multi-objective extensions---as soon as at least one feasible point is available. The calculation and optimization of the criterion are performed using Sequential Monte Carlo techniques. In particular, an algorithm similar to the subset simulation method, which is well known in the field of structural reliability, is used to estimate the criterion. The method, which we call BMOO (for Bayesian Multi-Objective Optimization), is compared to state-of-the-art algorithms for single- and multi-objective constrained optimization.},

Next, we develop two criteria to select a solution from obtained Pareto-optimal set to achieve the best possible implementation. Finally, the result verification is performed with Monte Carlo Simulations and also the quality improvement during manufacturing process is considered by identifying and controlling the critical variables.

This makes medoid shift considerably faster than mean shift, contrarily to what previously believed. We then exploit kernel methods to extend both mean shift and the improved medoid shift to a large family of distances, with complexity bounded by the effective rank of the resulting kernel matrix, and with explicit regularization constraints. Finally, we show that, under certain conditions, medoid shift fails to cluster data points belonging to the same mode, resulting in over-fragmentation. We propose remedies for this problem, by introducing a novel, simple and extremely efficient clustering algorithm, called quick shift, that explicitly trades off under- and overfragmentation. Like medoid shift, quick shift operates in non-Euclidean spaces in a straightforward manner. We also show that the accelerated medoid shift can be used to initialize mean shift for increased efficiency. We illustrate our algorithms to clustering data on manifolds, image segmentation, and the automatic discovery of visual categories.},

Despite the widespread application of BMA in the literature, there were not many accounts of these differences and trends besides a few landmark revisions in the late 1990s and early 2000s, therefore not taking into account any advancements made in the last 15 years.

With respect to the practice of robust optimization, we consider a broad spectrum of applications, in particular inventory and logistics, finance, revenue management, but also queueing networks, machine learning, energy systems and the public good. Key developments in the period from 2007 to present include: (i) an extensive body of work on robust decision-making under uncertainty with uncertain distributions, i.e., ``robustifying'' stochastic optimization, (ii) a greater connection with decision sciences by linking uncertainty sets to risk theory, (iii) further results on nonlinear optimization and sequential decision-making and (iv) besides more work on established families of examples such as robust inventory and revenue management, the addition to the robust optimization literature of new application areas, especially energy systems and the public good.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a stochastic approach to describe input uncertainties and their propagation through the nonlinear shallowwater equations. The formulation builds on a finite-volume model with a Godunov-type scheme for its shock capturing capabilities. Orthogonal polynomials from the Askey scheme provide expansion of the variables in terms of a finite number of modes from which the mean and higher-order moments of the distribution can be derived. The orthogonal property of the polynomials allows the use of a Galerkin projection to derive separate equations for the individual modes. Implementation of the polynomial chaos expansion and its nonintrusive counterpart determines the modal contributions from the resulting system of equations. Examples of long-wave transformation over a submerged hump illustrate the stochastic approach with uncertainties represented by Gaussian distribution. Additional results demonstrate the applicability of the approach with other distributions as well. The stochastic solution agrees well with the results from the Monte Carlo method, but at a small fraction of its computing cost.},

  abstract = {Many phenomena are modeled by deterministic differential equations , whereas the observation of these phenomena, in particular in life sciences, exhibits an important variability. This paper addresses the following question: how can the model be adapted to reflect the observed variability? Given an adequate model, it is possible to account for this variability by allowing some parameters to adopt a stochastic behavior. Finding the parameters probability density function that explains the observed variability is a difficult stochastic inverse problem, especially when the computational cost of the forward problem is high. In this paper, a non-parametric and non-intrusive procedure based on offline computations of the forward model is proposed. It infers the probability density function of the uncertain parameters from the matching of the statistical moments of observable degrees of freedom (DOFs) of the model. This inverse procedure is improved by incorporating an algorithm that selects a subset of the model DOFs that both reduces its computational cost and increases its robustness. This algorithm uses the pre-computed model outputs to build an approximation of the local sensitivities. The DOFs are selected so that the maximum information on the sensitivities is conserved. The proposed approach is illustrated with elliptic and parabolic PDEs. In the Appendix, an nonlinear ODE is considered and the strategy is compared with two existing ones.},

Many deterministic global optimization algorithms used in the field of computer experiments are based on Kriging (Gaussian process regression). Starting with a spatial predictor including a measure of uncertainty, they proceed by iteratively choosing the point maximizing a criterion which is a compromise between predicted performance and uncertainty. Distributing the evaluation of such numerically expensive objective functions on many processors is an appealing idea. Here we investigate a multi-points optimization criterion, the multipoints expected improvement ({$\mathsl{q}-\mathbb{E}\mathsl{I}$}q-EIq-\{\textbackslash mathbb E\}I), aimed at choosing several points at the same time. An analytical expression of the {$\mathsl{q}-\mathbb{E}\mathsl{I}$}q-EIq-\{\textbackslash mathbb E\}I is given when q\,=\,2, and a consistent statistical estimate is given for the general case. We then propose two classes of heuristic strategies meant to approximately optimize the {$\mathsl{q}-\mathbb{E}\mathsl{I}$}q-EIq-\{\textbackslash mathbb E\}I, and apply them to the classical Branin-Hoo test-case function. It is finally demonstrated within the covered example that the latter strategies perform as good as the best Latin Hypercubes and Uniform Designs ever found by simulation (2000 designs drawn at random for every q\,{$\in$} [1,10]).},

  abstract = {Typically, point forecasting methods are compared and assessed by means of an error measure or scoring function, such as the absolute error or the squared error. The individual scores are then averaged over forecast cases, to result in a summary measure of the predictive performance, such as the mean absolute error or the (root) mean squared error. I demonstrate that this common practice can lead to grossly misguided inferences, unless the scoring function and the forecasting task are carefully matched. Effective point forecasting requires that the scoring function be specified ex ante, or that the forecaster receives a directive in the form of a statistical functional, such as the mean or a quantile of the predictive distribution. If the scoring function is specified ex ante, the forecaster can issue the optimal point forecast, namely, the Bayes rule. If the forecaster receives a directive in the form of a functional, it is critical that the scoring function be consistent for it, in the sense that the expected score is minimized when following the directive. A functional is elicitable if there exists a scoring function that is strictly consistent for it. Expectations, ratios of expectations and quantiles are elicitable. For example, a scoring function is consistent for the mean functional if and only if it is a Bregman function. It is consistent for a quantile if and only if it is generalized piecewise linear. Similar characterizations apply to ratios of expectations and to expectiles. Weighted scoring functions are consistent for functionals that adapt to the weighting in peculiar ways. Not all functionals are elicitable; for instance, conditional value-at-risk is not, despite its popularity in quantitative finance.},

Proper scoring rules such as the logarithmic score and the continuous ranked probability score serve to assess calibration and sharpness simultaneously. As a special case, consistent scoring functions provide decision-theoretically coherent tools for evaluating point forecasts.

The ASMO-PODE can provide an estimation of the parameter distribution using as little as one percent of the model evaluations required by a regular MCMC approach.

  abstract = {Parameter specification usually has significant influence on the performance of land surface models (LSMs). However, estimating the parameters properly is a challenging task due to the following reasons: (1) LSMs usually have too many adjustable parameters (20 to 100 or even more), leading to the curse of dimensionality in the parameter input space; (2) LSMs usually have many output variables involving water/energy/carbon cycles, so that calibrating LSMs is actually a multi-objective optimization problem; (3) Regional LSMs are expensive to run, while conventional multi-objective optimization methods need a large number of model runs (typically {$\sim$} 105\textendash 106). It makes parameter optimization computationally prohibitive. An uncertainty quantification framework was developed to meet the aforementioned challenges, which include the following steps: (1) using parameter screening to reduce the number of adjustable parameters, (2) using surrogate models to emulate the responses of dynamic models to the variation of adjustable parameters, (3) using an adaptive strategy to improve the efficiency of surrogate modeling-based optimization; (4) using a weighting function to transfer multi-objective optimization to single-objective optimization. In this study, we demonstrate the uncertainty quantification framework on a single column application of a LSM \textendash{} the Common Land Model (CoLM), and evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework. The result indicate that this framework can efficiently achieve optimal parameters in a more effective way.

A particular technique that has emerged as a promising alternative to the time-consuming Monte-Carlo method for such analyses, is the polynomial chaos expansion (PCE). However, PCE-based methods suffer from a rapid increase in their computational cost with the number of random variables included in the analysis. This paper demonstrates that a hybrid Monte-Carlo/PCE technique can lead to the dramatic acceleration of its constituent methods, in the context of FDTD, effectively mitigating the ``curse of dimensionality'' and facilitating the multi-parametric uncertainty analysis of electromagnetic geometries.},

  abstract = {Flexible hierarchical Bayesian modeling of massive data is challenging due to poorly scaling computations in large sample size settings. This article is motivated by spatial process models for analyzing geostatistical data, which typically entail computations that become prohibitive as the number of spatial locations becomes large. We propose a three-step divide-and-conquer strategy within the Bayesian paradigm to achieve massive scalability for any spatial process model. We partition the data into a large number of subsets, apply a readily available Bayesian spatial process model on every subset in parallel, and optimally combine the posterior distributions estimated across all the subsets into a pseudo-posterior distribution that conditions on the entire data. The combined pseudo posterior distribution is used for predicting the responses at arbitrary locations and for performing posterior inference on the model parameters and the residual spatial surface. We call this approach "Distributed Kriging" (DISK). It offers significant advantages in applications where the entire data are or can be stored on multiple machines. Under the standard theoretical setup, we show that if the number of subsets is not too large, then the Bayes risk of estimating the true residual spatial surface using the DISK posterior distribution decays to zero at a nearly optimal rate. While DISK is a general approach to distributed nonparametric regression, we focus on its applications in spatial statistics and demonstrate its empirical performance using a stationary full-rank and a nonstationary low-rank model based on Gaussian process (GP) prior. A variety of simulations and a geostatistical analysis of the Pacific Ocean sea surface temperature data validate our theoretical results.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with the derivation of a probabilistic parametric model from interval or fuzzy data using the maximum likelihood principle. In contrast with classical techniques such as the EM algorithm, that define a precise likelihood function by averaging inside each imprecise observations, our approach presupposes that each imprecise observation underlies a precise one, and that the uncertainty that pervades its observation is epistemic, rather than representing noise. We define an interval-valued likelihood function and apply robust optimisation methods to find a safe plausible estimate of the statistical parameters. The resulting density has a standard deviation that is large enough to cover the imprecision of the observations, making a pessimistic assumption on dispersion. This approach is extended to fuzzy data by optimizing the average of lower likelihoods over a collection of data sets obtained from cuts of the fuzzy intervals, as a trade off between optimistic and pessimistic interpretations of fuzzy data. The principles of this method are compared with those of other existing approaches to handle incompleteness of observations, especially the EM technique.},

In the Pareto method, there is a dominated solution and a non-dominated solution obtained by a continuously updated algorithm. Meanwhile, the scalarization method creates multi-objective functions made into a single solution using weights. There are three types of weights in scalarization which are equal weights, rank order centroid weights, and rank-sum weights. Next, the solution using the Pareto method is a performance indicators component that forms MOO a separate and produces a compromise solution and can be displayed in the form of Pareto optimal front, while the solution using the scalarization method is a performance indicators component that forms a scalar function which is incorporated in the fitness function.},

In this paper, a notion of comparative likelihood when uncertainty is represented by a weighted set of probability measures is defined. It generalizes the ordering defined by probability (and by lower probability) in a natural way; a generalization of upper probability can also be defined.

This reformulation allows PES to obtain approximations that are both more accurate and efficient than other alternatives such as Entropy Search (ES).

We evaluate PES in both synthetic and realworld applications, including optimization problems in machine learning, finance, biotechnology, and robotics.

  abstract = {Interactions between meteorological and hydrodynamic processes are poorly understood, and may result in large uncertainties when assessing the performance of sea defences in extreme conditions. This study integrates numerical weather prediction models with models of wave generation and propagation, and surge and tide propagation. By using an ensemble methodology, the uncertainty at each stage of the model cascade may be quantified. Subsequently, this information, either as a proxy or appropriately transformed into predictive uncertainty, will be valuable in calculating the likelihood of hydraulic and structural failure in extreme storms. This paper describes results for a domain centred on one of the locations for the proposed Severn Barrage. This barrage will be the focus for the world's largest marine renewable energy scheme and will potentially have a significant impact on the coastal flooding response of this part of the Severn Estuary. Dynamically downscaled, high resolution wind and pressure fields of historic extreme storms are generated using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) modelling system. The state of the art tide and surge model, POLCOMS, in conjunction with a third generation wave model (ProWAM), utilises the meteorological data, producing hydrodynamic parameters such as surge and wave heights at a proposed location for the Severn Barrage. European Centre for Medium range Forecasting (ECMWF) Ensemble Prediction System data are used for boundary conditions in WRF, producing a 50-member ensemble. The variation in storm track and intensity between members allows the uncertainty in the model system to be quantified in terms of wave and surge heights. This work is part of the NERC funded EPIRUS consortium research but is closely allied to the interests of the EPSRC FRMRC project and the HEPEX international network focused on ensemble prediction in the context of hydrological prediction systems.},

Many deterministic global optimization algorithms used in the field of computer experiments are based on Kriging (Gaussian process regression). Starting with a spatial predictor including a measure of uncertainty, they proceed by iteratively choosing the point maximizing a criterion which is a compromise between predicted performance and uncertainty. Distributing the evaluation of such numerically expensive objective functions on many processors is an appealing idea. Here we investigate a multi-points optimization criterion, the multipoints expected improvement (q-EI), aimed at choosing several points at the same time. An analytical expression of the q-EI is given when q = 2, and a consistent statistical estimate is given for the general case. We then propose two classes of heuristic strategies meant to approximately optimize the q-EI, and apply them to the classical Branin-Hoo test-case function. It is finally demonstrated within the covered example that the latter strategies perform as good as the best Latin Hypercubes and Uniform Designs ever found by simulation (2000 designs drawn at random for every q {$\in$} [1, 10]).},

They are regions of immense societal importance through the goods and services they provide, hazards they pose and their role in global-scale processes and cycles, e.g. carbon fluxes and dense water formation. However, they are poorly represented in the current generation of global ocean models. In this contribution, we aim to briefly characterise the problem, and then to identify the important physical processes, and their scales, needed to address this issue in the context of the options available to resolve these scales globally and the evolving computational landscape.

We find barotropic and topographic scales are well resolved by the current state-of-the-art model resolutions, e.g. nominal 1/12\textdegree, and still reasonably well resolved at 1/4\textdegree; here, the focus is on process representation. We identify tides, vertical coordinates, river inflows and mixing schemes as four areas where modelling approaches can readily be transferred from regional to global modelling with substantial benefit. In terms of finer-scale processes, we find that a 1/12\textdegree{} global model resolves the first baroclinic Rossby radius for only {$\sim$} 8 \% of regions {$<$} 500 m deep, but this increases to {$\sim$} 70 \% for a 1/72\textdegree{} model, so resolving scales globally requires substantially finer resolution than the current state of the art.

We quantify the benefit of improved resolution and process representation using 1/12\textdegree{} global- and basin-scale northern North Atlantic nucleus for a European model of the ocean (NEMO) simulations; the latter includes tides and a k-{$\epsilon$} vertical mixing scheme. These are compared with global stratification observations and 19 models from CMIP5. In terms of correlation and basin-wide rms error, the high-resolution models outperform all these CMIP5 models. The model with tides shows improved seasonal cycles compared to the high-resolution model without tides. The benefits of resolution are particularly apparent in eastern boundary upwelling zones.

To explore the balance between the size of a globally refined model and that of multiscale modelling options (e.g. finite element, finite volume or a two-way nesting approach), we consider a simple scale analysis and a conceptual grid refining approach. We put this analysis in the context of evolving computer systems, discussing model turnaround time, scalability and resource costs. Using a simple cost model compared to a reference configuration (taken to be a 1/4\textdegree{} global model in 2011) and the increasing performance of the UK Research Councils' computer facility, we estimate an unstructured mesh multiscale approach, resolving process scales down to 1.5 km, would use a comparable share of the computer resource by 2021, the two-way nested multiscale approach by 2022, and a 1/72\textdegree{} global model by 2026. However, we also note that a 1/12\textdegree{} global model would not have a comparable computational cost to a 1\textdegree{} global model in 2017 until 2027. Hence, we conclude that for computationally expensive models (e.g. for oceanographic research or operational oceanography), resolving scales to {$\sim$} 1.5 km would be routinely practical in about a decade given substantial effort on numerical and computational development. For complex Earth system models, this extends to about 2 decades, suggesting the focus here needs to be on improved process parameterisation to meet these challenges.},

This problem can be modeled as a two-persons zero-sum game between an Engineer and Nature. The Engineer controls a subset of the variables (nodes in the graph), and tries to assign their values to maximize an objective function. Nature controls the complementary subset of variables and tries to minimize the same objective. This setting encompasses estimation and optimization problems under model uncertainty, and strategic problems with a graph structure. Von Neumann's minimax theorem guarantees the existence of a (minimax) pair of randomized strategies that provide optimal robustness for each player against its adversary. We prove several structural properties of this strategy pair in the case of graph-structured payoff function. In particular, the randomized minimax strategies (distributions over variable assignments) can be chosen in such a way to satisfy the Markov property with respect to the graph. This significantly reduces the problem dimensionality. Finally we introduce a message passing algorithm to solve this minimax problem. The algorithm generalizes max-product belief propagation to this new domain.},

  abstract = {Finding the optimal (lightest, least expensive, etc.) design for an engineered component that meets or exceeds a specified level of reliability is a problem of obvious interest across a wide spectrum of engineering fields. Various methods for this reliability-based design optimization problem have been proposed. Unfortunately, this problem is rarely solved in practice because, regardless of the method used, solving the problem is too expensive or the final solution is too inaccurate to ensure that the reliability constraint is actually satisfied. This is especially true for engineering applications involving expensive, implicit, and possibly nonlinear performance functions (such as large finite element models). The Efficient Global Reliability Analysis method was recently introduced to improve both the accuracy and efficiency of reliability analysis for this type of performance function. This paper explores how this new reliability analysis method can be used in a design optimization context to create a method of sufficient accuracy and efficiency to enable the use of reliability-based design optimization as a practical design tool.}

  abstract = {In this paper we provide a new simulation-based approach to maximum expected utility (MEU) portfolio allocation problems. MEU requires computation of expected utility and its optimization over the decision variable. In portfolio problems, the expected utility is generally not analytically available. Traditional methods resort to gradient-based estimates of expected utility with its ensuing derivatives. This leads to computational inefficiencies which are particularly acute in portfolio problems with parameter uncertainty (a.k.a. estimation risk). Our simulation-based method avoids the calculation of derivative and also allows for functional optimization. The algorithm combines Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) with the insights of simulated annealing and evolutionary Monte Carlo. It can exploit conjugate utility functions and latent variables in the relevant predictive density for efficient simulation. We also show how slice sampling naturally allows for constraints in the portfolio weights. We illustrate our methodology with a portfolio problem with estimation risk and CARA utility.},

  year = {2010},
  month = jul,
  abstract = {Robust analysis and optimization is typically based on repeated calls to a deterministic simulator that aim at propagating uncertainties and finding optimal design variables. Without loss of generality a double set of simulation parameters can be assumed: x are deterministic optimization variables, u are random parameters of known probability density function and f (x, u) is the objective function attached to the simulator. Most robust optimization methods involve two imbricated tasks, the u's uncertainty propagation (e.g., Monte Carlo simulations, reliability index calculation) which is recurcively performed inside optimization iterations on the x's. In practice, f is often calculated through a computationally expensive software. This makes the computational cost one of the principal obstacle to optimization in the presence of uncertainties. This report proposes a new efficient method for minimizing the mean objective function, min E[f(x, U)]. The efficiency stems from the simultaneous sampling of f for uncertainty propagation and optimization, i.e., the hierarchical imbrication is avoided. Y(x,u) ({$\omega$}), a kriging (Gaussian process conditioned on t past calculations of f) model of f (x, u) is built and the mean process, Z(x) ({$\omega$}) = E[Y(x,U)({$\omega$})], is analytically derived from it. The sampling criterion that yields both x and u is the one-step ahead minimum variance of the mean process Z at the maximizer of the expected improvement. The method is compared with Monte Carlo and kriging-based approaches on analytical test functions in two, four and six dimensions.},

For the first, we reverse the roles of estimation point x and datapoint Xi in each summand of the estimator. For the second, we provide kernels that are symmetric in x and X; these kernels are conditional densities of bivariate copulas. We develop asymptotic theory for the new estimators and compare them with Chen's in a substantial simulation study. We also develop automatic bandwidth selection in the form of `rule-of-thumb' bandwidths for all three estimators. We find that our second proposal, that based on `copula kernels', seems particularly competitive with the beta kernel method of Chen in integrated squared error performance terms. Advantages include its greater range of possible values at 0 and 1, the fact that it is a bona fide density, and that the individual kernels and resulting estimator are comprehensible in terms of a direct single picture (as is ordinary kernel density estimation on the line).},

  abstract = {In a 1935 paper, and in his book Theory of Probability, Jeffreys developed a methodology for quantifying the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. The centerpiece was a number, now called the Bayes factor, which is the posterior odds of the null hypothesis when the prior probability on the null is one-half. Although there has been much discussion of Bayesian hypothesis testing in the context of criticism of P-values, less attention has been given to the Bayes factor as a practical tool of applied statistics. In this paper we review and discuss the uses of Bayes factors in the context of five scientific applications. The points we emphasize are:- from Jeffreys's Bayesian point of view, the purpose of hypothesis testing is to evaluate the evidence in favor of a scientific theory;- Bayes factors offer a way of evaluating evidence in favor ofa null hypothesis;- Bayes factors provide a way of incorporating external information into the evaluation of evidence about a hypothesis;- Bayes factors are very general, and do not require alternative models to be nested;- several techniques are available for computing Bayes factors, including asymptotic approximations which are easy to compute using the output from standard packages that maximize likelihoods;- in "non-standard " statistical models that do not satisfy common regularity conditions, it can be technically simpler to calculate Bayes factors than to derive non-Bayesian significance},

  abstract = {We consider prediction and uncertainty analysis for systems which are approximated using complex mathematical models. Such models, implemented as computer codes, are often generic in the sense that by a suitable choice of some of the model's input parameters the code can be used to predict the behaviour of the system in a variety of specific applications. However, in any specific application the values of necessary parameters may be unknown. In this case, physical observations of the system in the specific context are used to learn about the unknown parameters. The process of fitting the model to the observed data by adjusting the parameters is known as calibration. Calibration is typically effected by ad hoc fitting, and after calibration the model is used, with the fitted input values, to predict the future behaviour of the system. We present a Bayesian calibration technique which improves on this traditional approach in two respects. First, the predictions allow for all sources of uncertainty, including the remaining uncertainty over the fitted parameters. Second, they attempt to correct for any inadequacy of the model which is revealed by a discrepancy between the observed data and the model predictions from even the best-fitting parameter values. The method is illustrated by using data from a nuclear radiation release at Tomsk, and from a more complex simulated nuclear accident exercise.},

We show that a special case of this, when the source is the prior and the target is the posterior, is Bayesian inference. Here, we can tractably calculate the normalization constant and draw posterior i.i.d. samples. Remarkably, our Bayesian tractability criterion is simply log concavity of the prior and likelihood: the same criterion for tractable calculation of the maximum a posteriori point estimate. With simulated data, we demonstrate how we can attain the Bayes risk in simulations. With physiologic data, we demonstrate improvements over point estimation in intensive care unit outcome prediction and electroencephalography-based sleep staging.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

While many sources of uncertainty may exist, they are generally categorized as either aleatory or epistemic. Uncertainties are characterized as epistemic, if the modeler sees a possibility to reduce them by gathering more data or by refining models. Uncertainties are categorized as aleatory if the modeler does not foresee the possibility of reducing them. From a pragmatic standpoint, it is useful to thus categorize the uncertainties within a model, since it then becomes clear as to which uncertainties have the potential of being reduced. More importantly, epistemic uncertainties may introduce dependence among random events, which may not be properly noted if the character of uncertainties is not correctly modeled. Influences of the two types of uncertainties in reliability assessment, codified design, performance-based engineering and risk-based decision-making are discussed. Two simple examples demonstrate the influence of statistical dependence arising from epistemic uncertainties on systems and time-variant reliability problems.},

Such parameters are frequently encountered in PDE-based models and correspond to quantities such as density or pressure fields, elasto-plastic moduli and internal variables in solid mechanics, conductivity fields in heat diffusion problems, permeability fields in fluid flow through porous media etc. The proposed model has all the advantages of traditional Bayesian formulations such as the ability to produce measures of confidence for the inferences made and providing not only predictive estimates but also quantitative measures of the predictive uncertainty. In contrast to existing approaches it utilizes a parsimonious, non-parametric formulation that favors sparse representations and whose complexity can be determined from the data. The proposed framework in non-intrusive and makes use of a sequence of forward solvers operating at various resolutions. As a result, inexpensive, coarse solvers are used to identify the most salient features of the unknown field(s) which are subsequently enriched by invoking solvers operating at finer resolutions. This leads to significant computational savings particularly in problems involving computationally demanding forward models but also improvements in accuracy. It is based on a novel, adaptive scheme based on Sequential Monte Carlo sampling which is embarrassingly parallelizable and circumvents issues with slow mixing encountered in Markov Chain Monte Carlo schemes.},

A robust layout is one that is close to the optimal solution for a wide variety of demand scenarios even though it may not be optimal under any specific demand scenario. In this paper, we develop algorithms to generate robust layout designs for manufacturing systems. Our robustness approach to the layout decision making can be applied to single and multiple period problems in the presence of considerable uncertainty, both in terms of products to be produced as well as their production volumes. Our algorithms, executed in a heuristic fashion, can be effectively used for layout design of large size manufacturing systems.},

Fundamentals are presented of a Bayesian forecasting system (BFS) for producing a probabilistic forecast of a hydrologic predictand via any deterministic catchment model.

This distribution results from a revision of a prior (climatic) distribution, is well calibrated, and has a nonnegative ex ante economic value.

  abstract = {Catchments that do not behave in the way the hydrologist expects, expose the frailties of hydrological science, particularly its unduly simplistic treatment of input and model uncertainty. A conceptual rainfall\textendash runoff model represents a highly simplified hypothesis of the transformation of rainfall into runoff. Sub-grid variability and mis-specification of processes introduce an irreducible model error, about which little is currently known. In addition, hydrological observation systems are far from perfect, with the principal catchment forcing (rainfall) often subject to large sampling errors. When ignored or treated simplistically, these errors develop into monsters that destroy our ability to model certain catchments. In this paper, these monsters are tackled using Bayesian Total Error Analysis, a framework that accounts for user-specified sources of error and yields quantitative insights into how prior knowledge of these uncertainties affects our ability to infer models and use them for predictive purposes. A case study involving a catchment with an apparent water balance anomaly (a hydrological monstrosity!) illustrates these concepts. It is found that, in the absence of additional information, the rainfall\textendash runoff record is insufficient to explain this anomaly \textendash{} it could be due to a large export of groundwater, systematic overestimation of catchment rainfall of the order of 40\%, or a conspiracy of these factors. There is ``no free lunch'' in hydrology. The rainfall\textendash runoff record on its own is insufficient to decompose the different sources of uncertainty affecting calibration, testing and prediction, and hydrological monstrosities will persist until additional independent knowledge of uncertainties is obtained.

  abstract = {In the present paper, the results of ongoing work within the FP7 project UMRIDA are presented and discussed. The main idea of this work is to combine the non-intrusive polynomial chaos based uncertainty quantification methods with the gradient based methods for stochastic optimization. When introducing uncertainties in a design process, the objective is no longer deterministic and can be characterized by its mean and its variance, i.e. in a robust design the optimization becomes multiobjective. Gradient based optimization of the mean objective and of the variance of the objective therefore requires the gradient of both quantities. The gradient of the mean objective is combined with the gradient of its variance using weights. By changing the weights, the Pareto front (if any, i.e. if the 2 objectives are conflicting) or at least part of it can be recovered. The proposed method is applied to the optimal shape design of the transonic RAE2822 airfoil under uncertainties. In the current work, the flight conditions (the Mach number and the angle of attack) are considered as uniformly distributed uncertain parameters. The objectives considered are the mean drag coefficient and its standard deviation. In this work, the adjoint solver and the CFD solver of SU2 (an open source CFD solver) are coupled with the polynomial chaos methods for the optimal shape design of a transonic airfoil. Hicks-Henne functions are employed to parameterize the airfoil and to represent a new geometry in the design process. The optimization procedure is performed using the sequential least square programming (SLSQP) algorithm. Two optimal designs are obtained by considering two different points on the Pareto front.},

  abstract = {In machine learning and statistics, probabilistic inference involving multimodal distributions is quite difficult. This is especially true in high dimensional problems, where most existing algorithms cannot easily move from one mode to another. To address this issue, we propose a novel Bayesian inference approach based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo. Our method can effectively sample from multimodal distributions, especially when the dimension is high and the modes are isolated. To this end, it exploits and modifies the Riemannian geometric properties of the target distribution to create \textbackslash emph\{wormholes\} connecting modes in order to facilitate moving between them. Further, our proposed method uses the regeneration technique in order to adapt the algorithm by identifying new modes and updating the network of wormholes without affecting the stationary distribution. To find new modes, as opposed to rediscovering those previously identified, we employ a novel mode searching algorithm that explores a \textbackslash emph\{residual energy\} function obtained by subtracting an approximate Gaussian mixture density (based on previously discovered modes) from the target density function.},

Function gradients are a common auxiliary information and are useful for predicting functions with locally changing behaviors. This article is a review of the main metamodels that use function gradients in addition to function values. The goal of the article is to give the reader both an overview of the principles involved in gradientenhanced metamodels while also providing insightful formulations. The following metamodels have gradient-enhanced versions in the literature and are reviewed here: classical, weighted and moving least squares, Shepard weighting functions, and the kernel-based methods that are radial basis functions, kriging and support vector machines. The methods are set in a common framework of linear combinations between a priori chosen functions and coefficients that depend on the observations. The characteristics common to all kernel-based approaches are underlined. A new {$\nu$}-GSVR metamodel which uses gradients is given. Numerical comparisons of the metamodels are carried out for approximating analytical test functions. The experiments are replicable, as they are performed with an opensource available toolbox. The results indicate that there is a trade-off between the better computing time of least squares methods and the larger versatility of kernelbased approaches.},

Yet the classical computation of the so-called Sobol' indices is based on Monte Carlo simulation, which is not af- fordable when computationally expensive models are used, as it is the case in most applications in engineering and applied sciences. In this respect metamodels such as polynomial chaos expansions (PCE) and Gaussian processes (GP) have received tremendous attention in the last few years, as they allow one to replace the original, taxing model by a surrogate which is built from an experimental design of limited size. Then the surrogate can be used to compute the sensitivity indices in negligible time. In this chapter an introduction to each technique is given, with an emphasis on their strengths and limitations in the context of global sensitivity analysis. In particular, Sobol' (resp. total Sobol') indices can be computed analytically from the PCE coefficients. In contrast, confidence intervals on sensitivity indices can be derived straightforwardly from the properties of GPs. The performance of the two techniques is finally compared on three well-known analytical benchmarks (Ishigami, G-Sobol and Morris functions) as well as on a realistic engineering application (deflection of a truss structure).},

A key problem in robust optimization is that the mean and the variation of a response cannot be calculated easily. This research presents an implementation of the approximate statistical moment method based on the Kriging metamodel. Furthermore, the statistics using the second-order statistical approximation method are adopted to avoid the local robust optimum. Thus, the probability of design-success, which is defined as the probability of satisfying the imposed design requirements, is represented as a function of approximate mean and variance. The formulation for the robust optimization can be defined as the probability of design-success of each response. The mathematical problem and the design problems of a two-bar structure and microgyroscope are investigated for the validation of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {1. Ecological count data typically exhibit complexities such as overdispersion and zero-inflation, and are often weakly associated with a relatively large number of correlated covariates. The use of an appropriate statistical model for inference is therefore essential. A common selection criteria for choosing between nested models is the likelihood ratio test (LRT). Widely used alternatives to the LRT are based on information-theoretic metrics such as the Akaike Information Criterion. 2. It is widely believed that the LRT can only be used to compare the performance of nested models \textendash{} i.e. in situations where one model is a special case of another. There are many situations in which it is important to compare non-nested models, so, if true, this would be a substantial drawback of using LRTs for model comparison. In reality, however, it is actually possible to use the LRT for comparing both nested and non-nested models. This fact is well-established in the statistical literature, but not widely used in ecological studies. 3. The main obstacle to the use of the LRT with non-nested models has, until relatively recently, been the fact that it is difficult to explicitly write down a formula for the distribution of the LRT statistic under the null hypothesis that one of the models is true. With modern computing power it is possible to overcome this difficulty by using a simulation-based approach. 4. To demonstrate the practical application of the LRT to both nested and non-nested model comparisons, a case study involving data on questing tick (Ixodes ricinus) abundance is presented. These data contain complexities typical in ecological analyses, such as zero-inflation and overdispersion, for which comparison between models of differing structure \textendash{} e.g. non-nested models \textendash{} is of particular importance. 5. Choosing between competing statistical models is an essential part of any applied ecological analysis. The LRT is a standard statistical test for comparing nested models. By use of simulation the LRT can also be used in an analogous fashion to compare non-nested models, thereby providing a unified approach for model comparison within the null hypothesis testing paradigm. A simple practical guide is provided in how to apply this approach to the key models required in the analyses of count data.},

We demonstrate that the straightforward sampling of a surrogate model can lead to erroneous results, no matter how accurate the surrogate model is. We then propose a hybrid approach by sampling both the surrogate model in a ``large'' portion of the probability space and the original system in a ``small'' portion. The resulting algorithm is significantly more efficient than the traditional sampling method, and is more accurate and robust than the straightforward surrogate model approach. Rigorous convergence proof is established for the hybrid approach, and practical implementation is discussed. Numerical examples are provided to verify the theoretical findings and demonstrate the efficiency gain of the approach.},

In this study, we develop a Bayesian model to estimate parameters associated with a geomorphology?based hydrological model (GBHM). The GBHM model uses geomorphic characteristics to simplify model structure and physically based methods to represent hydrological processes. We divide the observed discharge into low? and high?flow data, and use the first?order autoregressive model to describe their temporal dependence. We consider relative errors in rainfall as spatially distributed variables and estimate them jointly with the GBHM parameters. The joint posterior probability distribution is explored using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, which include Metropolis?Hastings, delay rejection adaptive Metropolis, and Gibbs sampling methods. We evaluate the Bayesian model using both synthetic and field data sets. The synthetic case study demonstrates that the developed method generally is effective in calibrating GBHM parameters and in estimating their associated uncertainty. The calibration ignoring input errors has lower accuracy and lower reliability compared to the calibration that includes estimation of the input errors, especially under model structure uncertainty. The field case study shows that calibration of GBHM parameters under complex field conditions remains a challenge. Although jointly estimating input errors and GBHM parameters improves the continuous ranked probability score and the consistency of the predictive distribution with the observed data, the improvement is incremental. To better calibrate parameters in a distributed model, such as GBHM here, we need to develop a more complex model and incorporate much more information.},

The traditional, double-loop RBDO algorithm requires nested optimization loops, where the design optimization (outer) loop, repeatedly calls a series of reliability (inner) loops. Due to the nested optimization loops, the computational effort can be prohibitive for practical problems. A single-loop RBDO algorithm is proposed in this paper for both normal and nonnormal random variables. Its accuracy is the same with the double-loop approach and its efficiency is almost equivalent to deterministic optimization. It collapses the nested optimization loops into an equivalent single-loop optimization process by imposing the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions of the reliability loops as equivalent deterministic equality constraints of the design optimization loop. It therefore, converts the probabilistic optimization problem into an equivalent deterministic optimization problem, eliminating the need for calculating the Most Probable Point (MPP) in repeated reliability assessments. Several numerical applications including an automotive vehicle side impact example, demonstrate the accuracy and superior efficiency of the proposed single-loop RBDO algorithm.},

We demonstrate that the likelihood ratio test statistics have finite-sample distributions that are functions of two independent Wishart variables and dependent on the covariance matrix of the combined multiple populations. Asymptotic calculations show that the likelihood ratio test statistics converge in distribution to central Chi-squared distributions under the null hypotheses regardless of how the populations are correlated. Following these theoretical findings, we propose a resampling procedure for the implementation of the likelihood ratio tests in which no restrictive assumption is imposed on the structures of the covariance matrices. The empirical size and power of the test procedure are investigated for various sample sizes via simulations. Two examples are provided for illustration. The results show good performance of the methods in terms of test validity and power.},

Instead, multiple plausible futures need to be considered, which requires (i) uncertainties to be described with the aid of scenarios that represent coherent future pathways based on different sets of assumptions, (ii) system performance to be represented by metrics that measure insensitivity (i.e. robustness) to changes in future conditions, and (iii) adaptive strategies to be considered alongside their more commonly used static counterparts. However, while these factors have been considered in isolation previously, there has been a lack of discussion of the way they are connected. In order to address this shortcoming, this paper presents a multidisciplinary perspective on how the above factors fit together to facilitate the development of strategies that are best suited to dealing with a deeply uncertain future.},

  abstract = {The goal of the paper is to design sequential strategies which lead to efficient optimization of an unknown function under the only assumption that it has a finite Lipschitz constant. We first identify sufficient conditions for the consistency of generic sequential algorithms and formulate the expected minimax rate for their performance. We introduce and analyze a first algorithm called LIPO which assumes the Lipschitz constant to be known. Consistency, minimax rates for LIPO are proved, as well as fast rates under an additional H\textasciidieresis older like condition. An adaptive version of LIPO is also introduced for the more realistic setup where the Lipschitz constant is unknown and has to be estimated along with the optimization. Similar theoretical guarantees are shown to hold for the adaptive LIPO algorithm and a numerical assessment is provided at the end of the paper to illustrate the potential of this strategy with respect to state-of-the-art methods over typical benchmark problems for global optimization.},

Consequently, insight into characteristics of the weighted sum method has far reaching implications. However, despite the many published applications for this method and the literature addressing its pitfalls with respect to depicting the Pareto optimal set, there is little comprehensive discussion concerning the conceptual significance of the weights and techniques for maximizing the effectiveness of the method with respect to a priori articulation of preferences. Thus, in this paper, we investigate the fundamental significance of the weights in terms of preferences, the Pareto optimal set, and objective-function values. We determine the factors that dictate which solution point results from a particular set of weights. Fundamental deficiencies are identified in terms of a priori articulation of preferences, and guidelines are provided to help avoid blind use of the method.},

  abstract = {The global sensitivity analysis of a complex numerical model often requires the estimation of variance-based importance measures, called Sobol' indices. Metamodel-based techniques have been developed in order to replace the cpu time expensive computer code with an inexpensive mathematical function, predicting the computer code output. The common metamodel-based sensitivity analysis methods are appropriate with computer codes having scalar model output. However, in the environmental domain, as in many areas of application, numerical models often give as output a spatial map, which is sometimes a spatio-temporal evolution, of some interest variables. In this paper, we introduce a novel way to obtain a spatial map of Sobol' indices with a minimal number of numerical model computations. It is based on the functional decomposition of the spatial output onto a wavelet basis and the metamodeling of the wavelet coefficients by Gaussian process. An analytical example allows us to clarify the various steps of our methodology. This technique is then applied to a real case of hydrogeological modeling: for each model input variable, a spatial map of Sobol' indices is thus obtained.},

Control variables must be tuned while environmental variables have an undesirable effect, to which the design of the control variables should be robust. The algorithm to be proposed searches for a minimax solution, i.e., values of the control variables that minimize the maximum of the objective function with respect to the environmental variables. The problem is particularly difficult when the control and environmental variables live in continuous spaces. Combining a relaxation procedure with Krigingbased optimization makes it possible to deal with the continuity of the variables and the fact that no analytical expression of the objective function is available in most real-case problems. Numerical experiments are conducted to assess the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm, both on analytical test functions with known results and on an engineering application.},

Computational challenges in this construction arise from the need for repeated evaluations of the forward model (e.g., in the context of Markov chain Monte Carlo) and are compounded by high dimensionality of the posterior. We address these challenges by introducing truncated Karhunen\textendash Lo\`eve expansions, based on the prior distribution, to efficiently parameterize the unknown field and to specify a stochastic forward problem whose solution captures that of the deterministic forward model over the support of the prior. We seek a solution of this problem using Galerkin projection on a polynomial chaos basis, and use the solution to construct a reduced-dimensionality surrogate posterior density that is inexpensive to evaluate. We demonstrate the formulation on a transient diffusion equation with prescribed source terms, inferring the spatially-varying diffusivity of the medium from limited and noisy data.},

Recent studies have shown that the application of different robustness metrics can result in different rankings of decision alternatives, but there has been little discussion of what potential causes for this might be. To shed some light on this issue, we present a unifying framework for the calculation of robustness metrics, which assists with understanding how robustness metrics work, when they should be used, and why they sometimes disagree. The framework categorizes the suitability of metrics to a decision-maker based on (1) the decision-context (i.e., the suitability of using absolute performance or regret), (2) the decision-maker's preferred level of risk aversion, and (3) the decision-maker's preference toward maximizing performance, minimizing variance, or some higher-order moment. This article also introduces a conceptual framework describing when relative robustness values of decision alternatives obtained using different metrics are likely to agree and disagree. This is used as a measure of how ``stable'' the ranking of decision alternatives is when determined using different robustness metrics. The framework is tested on three case studies, including water supply augmentation in Adelaide, Australia, the operation of a multipurpose regulated lake in Italy, and flood protection for a hypothetical river based on a reach of the river Rhine in the Netherlands. The proposed conceptual framework is confirmed by the case study results, providing insight into the reasons for disagreements between rankings obtained using different robustness metrics.},

  abstract = {Adjoint methods are nowadays widely used to efficiently perform optimization for problems with a large number of design variables. However, in reality, the problem at hand might be subjected to uncertainties in the operational conditions or, in case of optimizing geometries, the design variables itself might be uncertain due to manufacturing tolerances. For such applications, the optimum obtained using deterministic methods might be very sensitive to small variations in the uncertainties, i.e. it lacks robustness. In a robust optimization, the uncertainties are taken directly into account during the optimization process by introducing, next to the mean objective, its variance as a second objective. This implies that, when using gradient based optimization methods, the gradients of both objectives (mean and variance) must be known. In this work the Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) is used in combination with adjoint methods to efficiently obtain both gradients. A non intrusive, regression based PCE is used, requiring a new adjoint solution for each sampling point in order to build the PCE of the gradient. A PCE for the objective is also built (at no extra cost) in order to compute the gradient of the variance.},

  abstract = {The robustness of a design has a major influence on how much the product's performance will vary and is of great concern to design, quality and production engineers. While variability is always central to the definition of robustness, the concept does contain ambiguity and although subtle, this ambiguity can have significant influence on the strategies used to combat variability, the way it is quantified and ultimately, the quality of the final design. In this contribution the literature for robustness metrics was systematically reviewed. From the 108 relevant publications found, 38 metrics were determined to be conceptually different from one another. The metrics were classified by their meaning and interpretation based on the types of information necessary to calculate the metrics. Four different classes were identified: 1) Sensitivity robustness metrics; 2) Size of feasible design space robustness metrics; 3) Functional expectancy and dispersion robustness metrics; and 4) Probability of compliance robustness metrics. The goal was to give a comprehensive overview of robustness metrics and guidance to scholars and practitioners to understand the different types of robustness metrics and to remove the ambiguities of the term robustness. By applying an exemplar metric from each class to a case study, the differences between the classes were further highlighted. These classes form the basis for the definition of four specific sub-definitions of robustness, namely the `robust concept', `robust design', `robust function' and `robust product'.},

On the other hand, the problem is difficult because the integration is embedded in the maximization and has to possibly be evaluated many times for different design parameters.},

From this spectral likelihood expansion all statistical quantities of interest can be calculated semi-analytically. The posterior is formally represented as the product of a reference density and a linear combination of polynomial basis functions. Both the model evidence and the posterior moments are related to the expansion coefficients. This formulation avoids Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation and allows one to make use of linear least squares instead. The pros and cons of spectral Bayesian inference are discussed and demonstrated on the basis of simple applications from classical statistics and inverse modeling.},

  abstract = {Practical applications of nonparametric density estimators in more than three dimensions suffer a great deal from the well-known curse of dimensionality: convergence slows down as dimension increases. We show that one can evade the curse of dimensionality by assuming a simplified vine copula model for the dependence between variables. We formulate a general nonparametric estimator for such a model and show under high-level assumptions that the speed of convergence is independent of dimension. We further discuss a particular implementation for which we validate the high-level assumptions and establish its asymptotic normality. Simulation experiments illustrate a large gain in finite sample performance when the simplifying assumption is at least approximately true. But even when it is severely violated, the vine copula based approach proves advantageous as soon as more than a few variables are involved. Lastly, we give an application of the estimator to a classification problem from astrophysics.},

Considering a recently studied family of kernel estimators, we select a pointwise multivariate bandwidth by revisiting the greedy algorithm Rodeo (Regularisation Of Derivative Expectation Operator). The method addresses several issues: being greedy and computationally efficient by an iterative procedure, avoiding the curse of high dimensionality under some suitably defined sparsity conditions by early variable selection during the procedure, converging at a quasi-optimal minimax rate.},

Traditional methods of graphically comparing computational and experimental results, though valuable, are essentially qualitative. Computable measures are needed that can quantitatively compare computational and experimental results over a range of input, or control, variables to sharpen assessment of computational accuracy. This type of measure has been recently referred to as a validation metric. We discuss various features that we believe should be incorporated in a validation metric, as well as features that we believe should be excluded. We develop a new validation metric that is based on the statistical concept of confidence intervals. Using this fundamental concept, we construct two specific metrics: one that requires interpolation of experimental data and one that requires regression (curve fitting) of experimental data. We apply the metrics to three example problems: thermal decomposition of a polyurethane foam, a turbulent buoyant plume of helium, and compressibility effects on the growth rate of a turbulent free-shear layer. We discuss how the present metrics are easily interpretable for assessing computational model accuracy, as well as the impact of experimental measurement uncertainty on the accuracy assessment.},

Classical BO algorithms, however, do not account for errors about the location where observations are taken, which is a common issue in problems with physical components. In these cases, the estimation of the actual query location is also subject to uncertainty. In this context, we propose an upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithm for BO problems where both the outcome of a query and the true query location are uncertain. The algorithm employs a Gaussian process model that takes probability distributions as inputs. Theoretical results are provided for both the proposed algorithm and a conventional UCB approach within the uncertain-inputs setting. Finally, we evaluate each method's performance experimentally, comparing them to other input noise aware BO approaches on simulated scenarios involving synthetic and real data.},

Here we propose an information-theoretic formalization of bounded rational decision-making where decision-makers trade off expected utility and information processing costs. Such bounded rational decision-makers can be thought of as thermodynamic machines that undergo physical state changes when they compute. Their behavior is governed by a free energy functional that trades off changes in internal energy\textemdash as a proxy for utility\textemdash and entropic changes representing computational costs induced by changing states. As a result, the bounded rational decision-making problem can be rephrased in terms of well-known concepts from statistical physics. In the limit when computational costs are ignored, the maximum expected utility principle is recovered. We discuss the relation to satisficing decision-making procedures as well as links to existing theoretical frameworks and human decision-making experiments that describe deviations from expected utility theory. Since most of the mathematical machinery can be borrowed from statistical physics, the main contribution is to axiomatically derive and interpret the thermodynamic free energy as a model of bounded rational decision-making.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a strategy for improving the computational efficiency of model inversion using the method of anchored distributions (MAD) by ``bundling'' similar model parametrizations in the likelihood function. Inferring the likelihood function typically requires a large number of forward model (FM) simulations for each possible model parametrization; as a result, the process is quite expensive. To ease this prohibitive cost, we present an approximation for the likelihood function called bundling that relaxes the requirement for high quantities of FM simulations. This approximation redefines the conditional statement of the likelihood function as the probability of a set of similar model parametrizations ``bundle'' replicating field measurements, which we show is neither a model reduction nor a sampling approach to improving the computational efficiency of model inversion. To evaluate the effectiveness of these modifications, we compare the quality of predictions and computational cost of bundling relative to a baseline MAD inversion of 3-D flow and transport model parameters. Additionally, to aid understanding of the implementation we provide a tutorial for bundling in the form of a sample data set and script for the R statistical computing language. For our synthetic experiment, bundling achieved a 35\% reduction in overall computational cost and had a limited negative impact on predicted probability distributions of the model parameters. Strategies for minimizing error in the bundling approximation, for enforcing similarity among the sets of model parametrizations, and for identifying convergence of the likelihood function are also presented.},

That is, a product designed by robust design should be insensitive to external noises or tolerances. An insensitive design has more probability to obtain a target value, although there are uncertain noises. Theories of robust design have been developed by adopting the theories of other fields. Based on the theories, robust design can be classified into three methods: 1) the Taguchi method, 2) robust optimization, and 3) robust design with the axiomatic approach. Each method is reviewed and investigated. The methods are examined from a theoretical viewpoint and are discussed from an application viewpoint. The advantages and drawbacks of each method are discussed, and future directions for development are proposed.

  abstract = {Rare event dedicated techniques are of great interest for the aerospace industry because of the large amount money that can be lost because of risks associated with minute probabilities. This thesis is focused on the search of probability techniques able to estimate rare event probabilities and extreme quantiles associated with a black box system with static random inputs through two case studies from the industry. The first one is the estimation of the probability of collision between satellites Iridium and Cosmos. The Cross-Entropy (CE), the Non-parametric Adaptive Importance Sampling (NAIS) and an Adaptive Splitting Technique (AST) are compared. Through the comparison, an improved version of NAIS is designed. Whereas NAIS needs to be initiated with a auxiliary random variable which straight away generates rare events, the Adaptive NAIS (ANAIS) allows one to use the original input random as initial auxiliary density and therefore does not require a priori knowledge. The second case is the estimation of the safety zone with respect to the fall of a spacecraft booster. Though they can be estimated via ANAIS or AST, extreme quantiles are shown to be not adapted to spatial distribution. For that purpose, the Minimum Volume Set (MVS) is chosen from the literature. The Crude Monte Carlo (CMC) plug-in MVS estimator being not adapted to extreme level MVS estimation, both ANAIS and AST are adapted into plug-in extreme MVS estimators. These two algorithms outperform the CMC plug-in MVS estimator.},

Cet \'etat initial est reconstitu\'e en combinant les informations provenant du mod\`ele et des observations disponibles en utilisant des techniques d'assimilation de donn\'ees. Historiquement, les pr\'evisions et l'assimilation sont r\'ealis\'ees dans l'atmosph\`ere et l'oc\'ean de mani\`ere d\'ecoupl\'ee. Cependant, les centres op\'erationnels d\'eveloppent et utilisent de plus en plus des mod\`eles coupl\'es oc\'ean-atmosph\`ere. Or, assimiler des donn\'ees de mani\`ere d\'ecoupl\'ee n'est pas satisfaisant pour des syst\`emes coupl\'es. En effet, l'\'etat initial ainsi obtenu pr\'esente des inconsistances de flux \`a l'interface entre les milieux, engendrant des erreurs de pr\'evision. Il y a donc besoin d'adapter les m\'ethodes d'assimilation aux syst\`emes coupl\'es. Ces travaux de th\`ese s'inscrivent dans ce contexte et ont \'et\'e effectu\'es dans le cadre du projet FP7 ERA-Clim2, visant \`a produire une r\'eanalyse globale du syst\`eme terrestre.Dans une premi\`ere partie, nous introduisons les notions d'assimilation de donn\'ees, de couplage et les diff\'erentes m\'ethodologies existantes appliqu\'ees au probl\`eme de l'assimilation coupl\'ee. Ces m\'ethodologies n'\'etant pas satisfaisantes en terme de qualit\'e de couplage ou de co\^ut de calcul, nous proposons, dans une seconde partie, des m\'ethodes alternatives. Nous faisons le choix de m\'ethodes d'assimilation bas\'ees sur la th\'eorie du contr\^ole optimal. Ces alternatives se distinguent alors par le choix de la fonction co\^ut \`a minimiser, des variables contr\^ol\'ees et de l'algorithme de couplage utilis\'e. Une \'etude th\'eorique de ces algorithmes a permis de d\'eterminer un crit\`ere n\'ecessaire et suffisant de convergence dans un cadre lin\'eaire. Pour conclure cette seconde partie, les performances des diff\'erentes m\'ethodes introduites sont \'evalu\'ees en terme de qualit\'e de l'analyse produite et de co\^ut de calcul \`a l'aide d'un mod\`ele coupl\'e lin\'eaire 1D.

Nous avons alors pu \'evaluer la robustesse de nos algorithmes dans un cadre plus r\'ealiste, et conclure sur leurs performances vis \`a vis de m\'ethodes existantes. Le fait d'avoir d\'evelopp\'e nos m\'ethodes dans le cadre de OOPS devrait permettre \`a l'avenir de les appliquer ais\'ement \`a des mod\`eles r\'ealistes de pr\'evision.

  abstract = {We address the numerical solution of infinite-dimensional inverse problems in the framework of Bayesian inference. In the Part I companion to this paper (arXiv.org:1308.1313), we considered the linearized infinite-dimensional inverse problem. Here in Part II, we relax the linearization assumption and consider the fully nonlinear infinite-dimensional inverse problem using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling method. To address the challenges of sampling high-dimensional pdfs arising from Bayesian inverse problems governed by PDEs, we build on the stochastic Newton MCMC method. This method exploits problem structure by taking as a proposal density a local Gaussian approximation of the posterior pdf, whose construction is made tractable by invoking a low-rank approximation of its data misfit component of the Hessian. Here we introduce an approximation of the stochastic Newton proposal in which we compute the low-rank-based Hessian at just the MAP point, and then reuse this Hessian at each MCMC step. We compare the performance of the proposed method to the original stochastic Newton MCMC method and to an independence sampler. The comparison of the three methods is conducted on a synthetic ice sheet inverse problem. For this problem, the stochastic Newton MCMC method with a MAP-based Hessian converges at least as rapidly as the original stochastic Newton MCMC method, but is far cheaper since it avoids recomputing the Hessian at each step. On the other hand, it is more expensive per sample than the independence sampler; however, its convergence is significantly more rapid, and thus overall it is much cheaper. Finally, we present extensive analysis and interpretation of the posterior distribution, and classify directions in parameter space based on the extent to which they are informed by the prior or the observations.},

However, most energetic regions that have been identified as candidate sites for installation of TEC arrays exhibit some degree of directional and magnitude asymmetry between incident flood and ebb flow angles and velocities, particularly in nearshore environments where topographic, bathymetric and seabed frictional effects and interactions are significant. Understanding the contribution of directional and magnitude asymmetry to resource power density along with off axis rotor alignment to flow could influence site selection and help elucidate optimal turbine orientation. Here, 2D oceanographic model simulations and field data were analysed to investigate these effects at potential deployment locations in the Irish Sea; an energetic semi-enclosed shelf sea region. We find that observed sites exhibiting a high degree of asymmetry may be associated with a reduction of over 2\% in annual energy yield when deployment design optimisation is ignored. However, at the majority of sites, even in the presence of significant asymmetry, the difference is {$<$}0.3\%. Although the effects are shown to have less significance than other uncertainties in resource assessment, these impacts could be further investigated and quantified using CFD and 3D modelling.},

This model is a full general circulation model with on-line fully interactive chemistry involving 127 gas-phase and heterogeneous reactions. Thus, feedback between dynamics, chemistry and radiation occurs in every model time step. In this work, validation of the system for tropospheric and lower stratospheric analyses is undertaken with the standard observation set used in operational weather forecasting. Results are found to agree reasonably well with radiosonde observations and with Met Office (UK) analyses. Although ozone is not assimilated, ozone fields match total column observations well in terms of synoptic patterns. However, due to model biases, total column values are too large at mid-latitudes and too small in the tropics. Since the assimilation scheme was designed for tropospheric weather prediction, its application to a middle atmosphere model can help to identify the challenges of assimilating data from this region of the atmosphere.},

  abstract = {The expected improvement (EI) algorithm is a popular strategy for information collection in optimization under uncertainty. The algorithm is widely known to be too greedy, but nevertheless enjoys wide use due to its simplicity and ability to handle uncertainty and noise in a coherent decision theoretic framework. To provide rigorous insight into EI, we study its properties in a simple setting of Bayesian optimization where the domain consists of a finite grid of points. This is the so-called best-arm identification problem, where the goal is to allocate measurement effort wisely to confidently identify the best arm using a small number of measurements. In this framework, one can show formally that EI is far from optimal. To overcome this shortcoming, we introduce a simple modification of the expected improvement algorithm. Surprisingly, this simple change results in an algorithm that is asymptotically optimal for Gaussian best-arm identification problems, and provably outperforms standard EI by an order of magnitude.},

  abstract = {A framework for robust optimization under uncertainty based on the use of the generalized inverse distribution function (GIDF), also called quantile function, is here proposed. Compared to more classical approaches that rely on the usage of statistical moments as deterministic attributes that define the objectives of the optimization process, the inverse cumulative distribution function allows for the use of all the possible information available in the probabilistic domain. Furthermore, the use of a quantile based approach leads naturally to a multi-objective methodology which allows an a-posteriori selection of the candidate design based on risk/opportunity criteria defined by the designer. Finally, the error on the estimation of the objectives due to the resolution of the GIDF will be proven to be quantifiable},

This work develops a systematic framework for robust data assimilation. The new algorithms continue to produce good analyses in the presence of observation outliers. The approach is based on replacing the traditional \$\textbackslash L\_2\$ norm formulation of data assimilation problems with formulations based on \$\textbackslash L\_1\$ and Huber norms. Numerical experiments using the Lorenz-96 and the shallow water on the sphere models illustrate how the new algorithms outperform traditional data assimilation approaches in the presence of data outliers.},

  abstract = {Dans le secteur de l'automobile, les turbomachines sont des machines tournantes participant au refroidissement des moteurs des voitures. Leur performance d\'epend de multiples param\`etres g\'eom\'etriques qui d\'eterminent leur forme. Cette th\`ese s'inscrit dans le projet ANR PEPITO r\'eunissant industriels et acad\'emiques autour de l'optimisation de ces turbomachines. L'objectif du projet est de trouver la forme du ventilateur maximisant le rendement en certains points de fonctionnement. Dans ce but, les industriels ont d\'evelopp\'e des codes CFD (computational fluid dynamics) simulant le fonctionnement de la machine. Ces codes sont tr\`es co\^uteux en temps de calcul. Il est donc impossible d'utiliser directement le r\'esultat de ces simulations pour conduire une optimisation.Par ailleurs, lors de la construction des turbomachines, on observe des perturbations sur les param\`etres d'entr\'ee. Elles sont le reflet de fluctuations des machines de production. Les \'ecarts observ\'es sur la forme g\'eom\'etrique finale de la turbomachine peuvent provoquer une perte de performance cons\'equente. Il est donc n\'ecessaire de prendre en compte ces perturbations et de proc\'eder \`a une optimisation robuste \`a ces fluctuations. Dans ce travail de th\`ese, nous proposons des m\'ethodes bas\'ees sur du krigeage r\'epondant aux deux principales probl\'ematiques li\'ees \`a ce contexte de simulations co\^uteuses :\textbullet{}	Comment construire une bonne surface de r\'eponse pour le rendement lorsqu'il y a beaucoup de param\`etres g\'eom\'etriques ?\textbullet{}	Comment proc\'eder \`a une optimisation du rendement efficace tout en prenant en compte les perturbations des entr\'ees ?Nous r\'epondons \`a la premi\`ere probl\'ematique en proposant plusieurs algorithmes permettant de construire un noyau de covariance pour le krigeage adapt\'e \`a la grande dimension. Ce noyau est un produit tensoriel de noyaux isotropes o\`u chacun de ces noyaux est li\'e \`a un sous groupe de variables d'entr\'ee. Ces algorithmes sont test\'es sur des cas simul\'es et sur une fonction r\'eelle. Les r\'esultats montrent que l'utilisation de ce noyau permet d'am\'eliorer la qualit\'e de pr\'ediction en grande dimension. Concernant la seconde probl\'ematique, nous proposons plusieurs strat\'egies it\'eratives bas\'ees sur un co-krigeage avec d\'eriv\'ees pour conduire l'optimisation robuste. A chaque it\'eration, un front de Pareto est obtenu par la minimisation de deux objectifs calcul\'es \`a partir des pr\'edictions de la fonction co\^uteuse. Le premier objectif repr\'esente la fonction elle-m\^eme et le second la robustesse. Cette robustesse est quantifi\'ee par un crit\`ere estimant une variance locale et bas\'ee sur le d\'eveloppement de Taylor. Ces strat\'egies sont compar\'ees sur deux cas tests en petite et plus grande dimension. Les r\'esultats montrent que les meilleures strat\'egies permettent bien de trouver l'ensemble des solutions robustes. Enfin, les m\'ethodes propos\'ees sont appliqu\'ees sur les cas industriels propres au projet PEPITO.},

The multi objective methodology for robust optimization that requires the partitioning of the Pareto front (minimization of the function and the robustness criterion) has already been developed. However, the efficient estimation of the robustness criterion in the context of time-consuming simulation has not been much explored. We propose a robust optimization procedure based on the prediction of the function and its derivatives by a kriging. The 15 usual moment 2 is replaced by an approximated version using Taylor theorem. A Pareto front of the robust solutions is generated by a genetic algorithm named NSGA-II. This algorithm gives a Pareto front in an reasonable time of calculation. We detail seven relevant strategies and compare them for the same budget in two test functions (2D and 6D). In each case, we compare the results when the derivatives are observed and not.},

Those models allow us to identify individual behavior as a function of specific defensive settings, e.g. shot-behavior when a player is guarded closely. We assess our models using SportVU data for specific NBA players and our code is open-source to enable more players and teams explorations, as well as to support further research and application of those models, beyond basketball and sport.},

Unlike alternative approaches, including Expected Improvement, our proposed acquisition function avoids multi-dimensional integrations entirely, and can be computed exactly - even on large batch sizes - as the solution of a tractable convex optimization problem. Our suggested acquisition function can also be optimized efficiently, since first and second derivative information can be calculated inexpensively as by-products of the acquisition function calculation itself. We derive various novel theorems that ground our work theoretically and we demonstrate superior performance via simple motivating examples, benchmark functions and real-world problems.},

This tutorial covers the algorithm and its application, illustrating concepts through a range of examples, including Bernoulli bandit problems, shortest path problems, dynamic pricing, recommendation, active learning with neural networks, and reinforcement learning in Markov decision processes. Most of these problems involve complex information structures, where information revealed by taking an action informs beliefs about other actions.

Through geometry, seemingly distinct ideas are presented as the result of one common principle, making econometrics more than mere recipes or special tricks. In doing this, the author relies on such concepts as the linear vector space, orthogonality, and distance. Parts I and II introduce the ordinary least squares fitting method and the classical linear regression model, separately rather than simultaneously as in other texts. Part III contains generalizations of the classical linear regression model and Part IV develops the latent variable models that distinguish econometrics from statistics. To motivate formal results in a chapter, the author begins with substantive empirical examples. Main results are followed by illustrative special cases; technical proofs appear toward the end of each chapter. Intended for a graduate audience, An Introduction to Classical Econometric Theory fills the gap between introductory and more advanced texts. It is the most conceptually complete text for graduate econometrics courses and will play a vital role in graduate instruction.},

  abstract = {Mean shift clustering finds the modes of the data probability density by identifying the zero points of the density gradient. Since it does not require to fix the number of clusters in advance, the mean shift has been a popular clustering algorithm in various application fields. A typical implementation of the mean shift is to first estimate the density by kernel density estimation and then compute its gradient. However, since a good density estimation does not necessarily imply an accurate estimation of the density gradient, such an indirect two-step approach is not reliable. In this paper, we propose a method to directly estimate the gradient of the log-density without going through density estimation. The proposed method gives the global solution analytically and thus is computationally efficient. We then develop a mean-shift-like fixed-point algorithm to find the modes of the density for clustering. As in the mean shift, one does not need to set the number of clusters in advance. We experimentally show that the proposed clustering method significantly outperforms the mean shift especially for high-dimensional data.},

  abstract = {Over a decade ago the semidiurnal lunar M2 ocean tide was identified in CHAMP satellite magnetometer data. Since then and especially since the launch of the satellite magnetometer mission Swarm, electromagnetic tidal observations from satellites are used increasingly to infer electric properties of the upper lithosphere. In most of these inversions, numerical ocean tidal models are used to generate oceanic tidal electromagnetic signals via electromagnetic induction. The modelled signals are subsequently compared to the satellite observations. During the inversion, since the tidal models are considered error free, discrepancies between forward models and observations are projected only onto the induction part of the modelling, e.g., Earth's resistivity distribution. Our study analyses uncertainties in oceanic tidal models from an electromagnetic point of view. Velocities from hydrodynamic and assimilative tidal models are converted into tidal electromagnetic signals and compared. Respective uncertainties are estimated. The studies main goal is to provide errors for electromagnetic inversion studies. At satellite height, the differences between the hydrodynamic tidal models are found to reach up to 2 nT, i.e., over 100 \% of the M2 signal. Assimilative tidal models show smaller differences of up to 0.1 nT, i.e., over 30 \% of the M2 signal.},

We discretize the objective function with numerical quadrature and approximate the response density function with a Gaussian kernel density estimate. We offer heuristics for addressing issues that arise in this formulation, and we apply the approach to a CFD-based airfoil shape optimization problem.

We derive closed form expressions for the marginal likelihood and predictive distribution of a Student-t process, by integrating away an inverse Wishart process prior over the covariance kernel of a Gaussian process model. We show surprising equivalences between different hierarchical Gaussian process models leading to Student-t processes, and derive a new sampling scheme for the inverse Wishart process, which helps elucidate these equivalences. Overall, we show that a Student-t process can retain the attractive properties of a Gaussian process -- a nonparametric representation, analytic marginal and predictive distributions, and easy model selection through covariance kernels -- but has enhanced flexibility, and predictive covariances that, unlike a Gaussian process, explicitly depend on the values of training observations. We verify empirically that a Student-t process is especially useful in situations where there are changes in covariance structure, or in applications like Bayesian optimization, where accurate predictive covariances are critical for good performance. These advantages come at no additional computational cost over Gaussian processes.},

The book also provides an introduction to the subject for those with general interests in statistics. The important role of density estimation as a graphical technique is reflected by the inclusion of more than 50 graphs and figures throughout the text. Several contexts in which density estimation can be used are discussed, including the exploration and presentation of data, nonparametric discriminant analysis, cluster analysis, simulation and the bootstrap, bump hunting, projection pursuit, and the estimation of hazard rates and other quantities that depend on the density. This book includes general survey of methods available for density estimation. The Kernel method, both for univariate and multivariate data, is discussed in detail, with particular emphasis on ways of deciding how much to smooth and on computation aspects. Attention is also given to adaptive methods, which smooth to a greater degree in the tails of the distribution, and to methods based on the idea of penalized likelihood.}

  abstract = {A 2D numerical model of the shelf seas around the U.K. is used to derive the M2 tide and the M4 and M6 tidal harmonics. The accuracy of the tidal harmonics is shown to be related to the form of the dissipation. In particular a quadratic form of the bottom friction results in unrealistically high amplitudes for the M6 tide. It is shown that this effect can be reduced by use of a combination of a linearised friction tensor and quadratic friction without significantly affecting the M2 constituent. The role of diffusion in controlling the amplitude of the M4 tide is demonstrated. The 2D results provide a baseline or reference solution for further development using 3D and/or multiconstituent models. Amplitude and phase diagrams derived from the model show a progression with frequency in the North Sea and the English Channel suggestive of a transition from Kelvin wave to Poincar\'e wave propagation. It is shown that both the North Sea and the English Channel can be considered from the point of view of waves propagating in a closed channel in the presence of friction. For the inviscid case, the critical frequency above which Poincar\'e waves are able to propagate is calculated to be between the M2 and M4 frequencies for the North Sea and between the M6 and M8 frequencies for the English Channel. A dispersion relation is derived for Poincar\'e and Kelvin waves in the presence of friction. Both types of wave possess decaying and propagating characteristics when friction is present with wavelength and decay scale dependent on frequency and the coefficient of friction. There is no longer a sharp critical frequency, but instead a transition region where wavelength and decay scales vary relatively rapidly with frequency. The response of a semi-infinite rectangular channel to Kelvin and Poincar\'e wave propagation is calculated providing a partial explanation of the numerical model results. \textcopyright{} 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd},

  abstract = {Many objectives have been proposed for optimization under uncertainty. The typical stochastic programming ob-jective of minimizing expected cost may yield solutions that are inexpensive in the long run but perform poorly under certain realizations of the random data. On the other hand, the typical robust optimization objective of minimizing maximum cost or regret tends to be overly conservative, planning against a disastrous but unlikely scenario. In this paper, we present facility location models that combine the two objectives by minimizing the expected cost while bounding the relative regret in each scenario. In particular, the models seek the minimum-expected-cost solution that is p-robust; i.e., whose relative regret is no more than 100p\% in each scenario. We present p-robust models based on two classical facility location problems, the P -median problem and the uncapacitated fixed-charge location problem. We solve both problems using variable splitting (Lagrangian decomposition), in which the subproblem reduces to the multiple-choice knapsack problem. Feasible solutions are found using an upper-bounding heuristic. For many instances of the problems, finding a feasible solution, and even determining whether the instance is feasible, is difficult; we discuss a mechanism for determining infeasibility. We also show how the algorithm can be used as a heuristic to solve minimax-regret versions of the location problems.},

We formalize this task as a multi-armed bandit problem, where the payoff function is either sampled from a Gaussian process (GP) or has low RKHS norm. We resolve the important open problem of deriving regret bounds for this setting, which imply novel convergence rates for GP optimization. We analyze GP-UCB, an intuitive upper-confidence based algorithm, and bound its cumulative regret in terms of maximal information gain, establishing a novel connection between GP optimization and experimental design. Moreover, by bounding the latter in terms of operator spectra, we obtain explicit sublinear regret bounds for many commonly used covariance functions. In some important cases, our bounds have surprisingly weak dependence on the dimensionality. In our experiments on real sensor data, GP-UCB compares favorably with other heuristical GP optimization approaches.},

Traditional measures for binary and survival outcomes include the Brier score to indicate overall model performance, the concordance (or c) statistic for discriminative ability (or area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve), and goodness-of-fit statistics for calibration., Several new measures have recently been proposed that can be seen as refinements of discrimination measures, including variants of the c statistic for survival, reclassification tables, net reclassification improvement (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). Moreover, decision\textendash analytic measures have been proposed, including decision curves to plot the net benefit achieved by making decisions based on model predictions., We aimed to define the role of these relatively novel approaches in the evaluation of the performance of prediction models. For illustration we present a case study of predicting the presence of residual tumor versus benign tissue in patients with testicular cancer (n=544 for model development, n=273 for external validation)., We suggest that reporting discrimination and calibration will always be important for a prediction model. Decision-analytic measures should be reported if the predictive model is to be used for making clinical decisions. Other measures of performance may be warranted in specific applications, such as reclassification metrics to gain insight into the value of adding a novel predictor to an established model.},

  abstract = {Global sensitivity analysis (SA) aims at quantifying the respective effects of input random variables (or combinations thereof) onto the variance of the response of a physical or mathematical model. Among the abundant literature on sensitivity measures, the Sobol' indices have received much attention since they provide accurate information for most models. The paper introduces generalized polynomial chaos expansions (PCE) to build surrogate models that allow one to compute the Sobol' indices analytically as a post-processing of the PCE coefficients. Thus the computational cost of the sensitivity indices practically reduces to that of estimating the PCE coefficients. An original non intrusive regression-based approach is proposed, together with an experimental design of minimal size. Various application examples illustrate the approach, both from the field of global SA (i.e. well-known benchmark problems) and from the field of stochastic mechanics. The proposed method gives accurate results for various examples that involve up to eight input random variables, at a computational cost which is 2\textendash 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the traditional Monte Carlo-based evaluation of the Sobol' indices.},

Existing approaches link data and VaR indirectly by first linking data to the parameter of a probability model, and then expressing VaR as a function of that parameter. This indirect approach exposes the insurer to model misspecification bias or estimation inefficiency, depending on whether the parameter is finite- or infinite-dimensional. In this paper, we link data and VaR directly via what we call a discrepancy function, and this leads naturally to a Gibbs posterior distribution for VaR that does not suffer from the aforementioned biases and inefficiencies. Asymptotic consistency and root-n concentration rate of the Gibbs posterior are established, and simulations highlight its superior finite-sample performance compared to other approaches.},

  abstract = {Maximum likelihood estimation and likelihood ratio tests for nonlinear, non-Gaussian state-space models require numerical integration for likelihood calculations. Several methods, including Monte Carlo (MC) expectation maximization, MC likelihood ratios, direct MC integra-tion, and particle  lter likelihoods, are inef  cient for the motivating problem of stage-structured population dynamics models in experimen-tal settings. An MC kernel likelihood (MCKL) method is presented that estimates classical likelihoods up to a constant by weighted kernel density estimates of Bayesian posteriors. MCKL is derived by using Bayesian posteriors as importance sampling densities for unnormalized kernel smoothing integrals. MC error and mode bias due to kernel smoothing are discussed and two methods for reducing mode bias are proposed: ``zooming in '' on the maximum likelihood parameters using a focused prior based on an initial estimate and using a posterior cumulant-based approximation of mode bias. A simulated example shows that MCKL can be much more ef  cient than previous approaches for the population dynamics problem. The zooming-in and cumulant-based corrections are illustrated with a multivariate variance estimation problem for which accurate results are obtained even in 20 parameter dimensions.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses optimization problems constrained by partial differential equations with uncertain coefficients. In particular, the robust control problem and the average control problem are considered for a tracking type cost functional with an additional penalty on the variance of the state. The expressions for the gradient and Hessian corresponding to either problem contain expected value operators. Due to the large number of uncertainties considered in our model, we suggest to evaluate these expectations using a multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) method. Under mild assumptions, it is shown that this results in the gradient and Hessian corresponding to the MLMC estimator of the original cost functional. Furthermore, we show that the use of certain correlated samples yields a reduction in the total number of samples required. Two optimization methods are investigated: the nonlinear conjugate gradient method and the Newton method. For both, a specific algorithm is provided that dynamically decides which and how many samples should be taken in each iteration. The cost of the optimization up to some specified tolerance \$\textbackslash tau\$ is shown to be proportional to the cost of a gradient evaluation with requested root mean square error \$\textbackslash tau\$. The algorithms are tested on a model elliptic diffusion problem with lognormal diffusion coefficient. An additional nonlinear term is also considered.},

  abstract = {We consider the problem of maximizing a real-valued continuous function f using a Bayesian approach. Since the early work of Jonas Mockus and Antanas Z\textasciicaron{} ilinskas in the 70's, the problem of optimization is usually formulated by considering the loss function max f - Mn (where Mn denotes the best function value observed after n evaluations of f ). This loss function puts emphasis on the value of the maximum, at the expense of the location of the maximizer. In the special case of a one-step Bayes-optimal strategy, it leads to the classical Expected Improvement (EI) sampling criterion. This is a special case of a Stepwise Uncertainty Reduction (SUR) strategy, where the risk associated to a certain uncertainty measure (here, the expected loss) on the quantity of interest is minimized at each step of the algorithm. In this article, assuming that f is defined over a measure space (X, {$\lambda$}), we propose to consider instead the integral loss function X( f - Mn)+ d{$\lambda$}, and we show that this leads, in the case of a Gaussian process prior, to a new numerically tractable sampling criterion that we call EI2 (for Expected Integrated Expected Improvement). A numerical experiment illustrates that a SUR strategy based on this new sampling criterion reduces the error on both the value and the location of the maximizer faster than the EI-based strategy.},

  abstract = {In many global optimization problems motivated by engineering applications, the number of function evaluations is severely limited by time or cost. To ensure that each evaluation contributes to the localization of good candidates for the role of global minimizer, a sequential choice of evaluation points is usually carried out. In particular, when Kriging is used to interpolate past evaluations, the uncertainty associated with the lack of information on the function can be expressed and used to compute a number of criteria accounting for the interest of an additional evaluation at any given point. This paper introduces minimizer entropy as a new Kriging-based criterion for the sequential choice of points at which the function should be evaluated. Based on stepwise uncertainty reduction, it accounts for the informational gain on the minimizer expected from a new evaluation. The criterion is approximated using conditional simulations of the Gaussian process model behind Kriging, and then inserted into an algorithm similar in spirit to the Efficient Global Optimization (EGO) algorithm. An empirical comparison is carried out between our criterion and expected improvement, one of the reference criteria in the literature. Experimental results indicate major evaluation savings over EGO. Finally, the method, which we call IAGO (for Informational Approach to Global Optimization) is extended to robust optimization problems, where both the factors to be tuned and the function evaluations are corrupted by noise.},

  abstract = {Bayesian Optimization or Efficient Global Optimization (EGO) is a global search strategy that is designed for expensive black-box functions. In this algorithm, a statistical model (usually the Gaussian process model) is constructed on some initial data samples. The global optimum is approached by iteratively maximizing a so-called acquisition function, that balances the exploration and exploitation effect of the search. The performance of such an algorithm is largely affected by the choice of the acquisition function. Inspired by the usage of higher moments from the Gaussian process model, it is proposed to construct a novel acquisition function based on the moment-generating function (MGF) of the improvement, which is the stochastic gain over the current best fitness value by sampling at an unknown point. This MGF-based acquisition function takes all the higher moments into account and introduces an additional real-valued parameter to control the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. The motivation, rationale and closed-form expression of the proposed function are discussed in detail. In addition, we also illustrate its advantage over other acquisition functions, especially the so-called generalized expected improvement.},

  abstract = {We consider the problem of global optimization of an unknown non-convex smooth function with zeroth-order feedback. In this setup, an algorithm is allowed to adaptively query the underlying function at different locations and receives noisy evaluations of function values at the queried points (i.e. the algorithm has access to zeroth-order information). Optimization performance is evaluated by the expected difference of function values at the estimated optimum and the true optimum. In contrast to the classical optimization setup, first-order information like gradients are not directly accessible to the optimization algorithm. We show that the classical minimax framework of analysis, which roughly characterizes the worst-case query complexity of an optimization algorithm in this setting, leads to excessively pessimistic results. We propose a local minimax framework to study the fundamental difficulty of optimizing smooth functions with adaptive function evaluations, which provides a refined picture of the intrinsic difficulty of zeroth-order optimization. We show that for functions with fast level set growth around the global minimum, carefully designed optimization algorithms can identify a near global minimizer with many fewer queries. For the special case of strongly convex and smooth functions, our implied convergence rates match the ones developed for zeroth-order convex optimization problems [1, 22]. At the other end of the spectrum, for worst-case smooth functions no algorithm can converge faster than the minimax rate of estimating the entire unknown function in the {$\mathscr{l}$}8-norm. We provide an intuitive and efficient algorithm that attains the derived upper error bounds. Finally, using the local minimax framework we are able to clearly dichotomize adaptive and non-adaptive algorithms by showing that non-adaptive algorithms, although optimal in a global minimax sense, do not attain the optimal local minimax rate.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a score that can be used for evaluating probabilistic forecasts of multicategory events. The score is a reinterpretation of the logarithmic score or ignorance score, now formulated as the relative entropy or Kullback\textendash Leibler divergence of the forecast distribution from the observation distribution. Using the information\textendash theoretical concepts of entropy and relative entropy, a decomposition into three components is presented, analogous to the classic decomposition of the Brier score. The information\textendash theoretical twins of the components uncertainty, resolution, and reliability provide diagnostic information about the quality of forecasts. The overall score measures the information conveyed by the forecast. As was shown recently, information theory provides a sound framework for forecast verification. The new decomposition, which has proven to be very useful for the Brier score and is widely used, can help acceptance of the logarithmic score in meteorology.},

It also develops a two-step procedure for estimating all the relevant quantities under the new parameterization. This estimation procedure is shown to enjoy excellent rates of convergence and can be straightforwardly implemented with existing software. For uncertainty quantification, bootstrapping is adopted to construct confidence regions for the quantities of interest. The practical performance of the proposed methodology is illustrated through simulation examples and an application to a computational fluid dynamics model.},

However, unlike most optimization methods, Bayesian optimization typically does not use derivative information. In this paper we show how Bayesian optimization can exploit derivative information to find good solutions with fewer objective function evaluations. In particular, we develop a novel Bayesian optimization algorithm, the derivative-enabled knowledgegradient (d-KG), which is one-step Bayes-optimal, asymptotically consistent, and provides greater one-step value of information than in the derivative-free setting. d-KG accommodates noisy and incomplete derivative information, comes in both sequential and batch forms, and can optionally reduce the computational cost of inference through automatically selected retention of a single directional derivative. We also compute the d-KG acquisition function and its gradient using a novel fast discretization-free technique. We show d-KG provides state-of-the-art performance compared to a wide range of optimization procedures with and without gradients, on benchmarks including logistic regression, deep learning, kernel learning, and k-nearest neighbors.},

"Expert opinion" and "user self-evaluation" have been widely used to specify computer model input uncertainties in previous uncertainty, sensitivity and validation studies. Inverse Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is the process to inversely quantify input uncertainties based on experimental data in order to more precisely quantify such ad-hoc specifications of the input uncertainty information. In this paper, we used Bayesian analysis to establish the inverse UQ formulation, with systematic and rigorously derived metamodels constructed by Gaussian Process (GP). Due to incomplete or inaccurate underlying physics, as well as numerical approximation errors, computer models always have discrepancy/bias in representing the realities, which can cause over-fitting if neglected in the inverse UQ process. The model discrepancy term is accounted for in our formulation through the "model updating equation". We provided a detailed introduction and comparison of the full and modular Bayesian approaches for inverse UQ, as well as pointed out their limitations when extrapolated to the validation/prediction domain. Finally, we proposed an improved modular Bayesian approach that can avoid extrapolating the model discrepancy that is learnt from the inverse UQ domain to the validation/prediction domain.},

The likelihood function is approximated by a ridge function, i.e., a map which depends non-trivially only on a few linear combinations of the parameters. We build this ridge approximation by minimizing an upper bound on the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the posterior distribution and its approximation. This bound, obtained via logarithmic Sobolev inequalities, allows one to certify the error of the posterior approximation. Computing the bound requires computing the second moment matrix of the gradient of the log-likelihood function. In practice, a sample-based approximation of the upper bound is then required. We provide an analysis that enables control of the posterior approximation error due to this sampling. Numerical and theoretical comparisons with existing methods illustrate the benefits of the proposed methodology.},

A decoupled approach is proposed in this paper to un-nest the robustness-based design from the analysis of non-design epistemic variables to achieve computational efficiency. The proposed methods are illustrated for the upper stage design problem of a two-stage-toorbit (TSTO) vehicle, where the information on the random design inputs are only available as sparse point and/or interval data. As collecting more data reduces uncertainty but increases cost, the effect of sample size on the optimality and robustness of the solution is also studied. A method is developed to determine the optimal sample size for sparse point data that leads to the solutions of the design problem that are least sensitive to variations in the input random variables.},

SAME (State Augmentation for Marginal Estimation) \textbackslash cite\{Doucet99,Doucet02\} is an approach to MAP parameter estimation which gives improved parameter estimates over direct Gibbs sampling. SAME can be viewed as cooling the posterior parameter distribution and allows annealed search for the MAP parameters, often yielding very high quality (lower loss) estimates. But it does so at the expense of additional samples per iteration and generally slower performance. On the other hand, SAME dramatically increases the parallelism in the sampling schedule, and is an excellent match for modern (SIMD) hardware. In this paper we explore the application of SAME to graphical model inference on modern hardware. We show that combining SAME with factored sample representation (or approximation) gives throughput competitive with the fastest symbolic methods, but with potentially better quality. We describe experiments on Latent Dirichlet Allocation, achieving speeds similar to the fastest reported methods (online Variational Bayes) and lower cross-validated loss than other LDA implementations. The method is simple to implement and should be applicable to many other models.},

In the presence of pronounced noise, however, multiple models are often found to explain the same data equally well. To resolve this model selection ambiguity, we introduce the general approach of model selection confidence sets (MSCSs) based on likelihood ratio testing. A MSCS is defined as a list of models statistically indistinguishable from the true model at a user-specified level of confidence, which extends the familiar notion of confidence intervals to the model-selection framework. Our approach guarantees asymptotically correct coverage probability of the true model when both sample size and model dimension increase. We derive conditions under which the MSCS contains all the relevant information about the true model structure. In addition, we propose natural statistics based on the MSCS to measure importance of variables in a principled way that accounts for the overall model uncertainty. When the space of feasible models is large, MSCS is implemented by an adaptive stochastic search algorithm which samples MSCS models with high probability. The MSCS methodology is illustrated through numerical experiments on synthetic data and real data examples.},
