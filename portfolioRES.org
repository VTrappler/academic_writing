This portfolio has been written in the context of the Research and
Teaching label of the [[https://doctorat.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/fr/pendant-la-these/la-formation-durant-la-these/parcours-labels/label-res-recherche-et-enseignement-superieur-577252.htm][Université Grenoble Alpes]], often shortened as
*RES label* in french.

* Introduction
 Labels of the UGA were implemented in order to offer a coherent set
of courses, tutorial and formal training to PhD students for their
future career whether in academia or in the industry.  This portfolio
is a personal document, that aims at describing what "teaching" means
to me, and how the actual hours spent in the classroom and in training
shaped my way of teaching, either volontarily, or not.  From september
2017 to december 2019, my teaching load summed to 136 hours in L1 and
L2 (first and second year students at the university), and are
summarized in the table below. A more precise feedback on those
courses will be introduced later.

In this portfolio, I will first discuss the role of the
teacher/lecturer in higher-education from my personal
experience. Afterward, I will comment on some aspects of teaching I
encountered.

* Teaching from a personal point of view
  <<sec:teaching>>
** Teaching ?
  What does it mean to teach students ? For me, the definition would
take this form:

As a "specialist" in a certain field, how to transmit
the essential elements of a certain curriculum so that the students
are competent enough to get a passing grade for the course and be able
to tackle autonomously harder challenges of the curriculum".  This
definition highlights two different objectives, often linked:

  + Courses at the university have to be graded in order to measure in
    a sense the level of knowledge acquired by the students.
  + Courses are building blocks that help students define their own
    academic interest, and prepare them for their future career, in
    academia, the private sector or other.
  
In that sense, I judge important the fact that the course material
could/should aim at developing core competences, and intuition as
well.

** My own experience as a student
One particular fact about my own experience, is that before enrolling
as a PhD student at the UGA, I have never been attended a "classical
french university". After my Baccalauréat, I spent two years in CPGE,
then two years in an "École d'Ingénieurs" (ECL). Afterward, to complete my
engineering degree, I enrolled for a double-degree at DTU (Danmarks
Tekniske Universitet) in Denmark. Those three different establishments
carried three different teaching methods: 
 - One approach very similar to high-school (CPGE).
 - One approach closer to french higher-education system (ECL).
 - One approach that I will qualify as discussion-based (DTU).
** Different teaching methods
 The first approach can be described as very school-like, with precise
 school classes, and few interactions between them. Due to the nature
 of the curriculum, especially with the regular oral interrogation
 sessions, each student could get quickly a feedback on its work and
 its progression. Keeping the same teachers for the whole year also
 meant that students could adapt to the different teaching methods.


 In engineering school, the teachings are much more specialized,
 spanning a lot more subjects. This leads to a high number of teachers
 (in charge of lectures and tutorial/exercise sessions), and a high
 number of teaching assistants (in charge of tutorial/exercise
 sessions). From my own point-of-view, this led to gap between
 lectures and exercises. Most often than not, I recall that the TA had
 to recap the lectures, as students had a hard time distinguishing
 what was crucial for the tests, and what was out of scope. Of course,
 the sheer number of students enrolled renders an approach with closer
 feedback and links between lectures and exercises impossible.

 Finally, in Denmark, the organisation was slightly different. Most of
 the courses were scheduled in blocks of four hours, where the first
 two were dedicated to lectures, and the remaining hours were
 dedicated to an exercise session. During those sessions, the students
 were in fact almost completely autonomous, but could ask for help
 from the lecturer or from the teaching assistants at any point, if
 needed. I noticed that this autonomy helped some students, as they
 could leave the class early if they felt like it, or could engage
 with the teacher or TA in some discussions. Those discussions felt
 very gratifying, as we could directly clarify some points in the
 lectures, or discuss some related topics.
** Some observations drawn from these experiences

From these experiences, I gathered that the engagement of the students
is very important in teaching, and that this engagement can come from
regular two-way feedbacks.

 For the teacher, it is important as it helps to see where the
students stand with respect to their comprehension of the curriculum,
or if they feel left behind or bored, and thus disengaging. More
precisely, the teacher can gauge if some points have been
misunderstood, or if some topics raise the curiosity of some students,
that could help motivate them.


From a student point of view, regular feedbacks from the teacher can
help to see if they are on track to pass the course, and if the
teacher takes into account those feedbacks, it can help improve the
teaching experience for everyone involved.

* Lectures, autonomy and confidence
As said earlier, I was a TA in some courses for exercises and lab
sessions. For one of those courses, it was an exercise session and a
lecture combined. All of those were with groups of approximately 30
students. 
** Developing an intuition
During those classes I tried to engage with students, by providing
regular feedbacks, and develop what I call "mathematical intuition".
This intuition takes several form, but I wanted the students to
understand exactly what was expected of them, as soon as they read the
question. Then, they would be able to use the appropriate mathematical
tools, in order to prove or compute what they had imagined before.

I tried to work on this by asking first opinions about questions:
  + "What do you think of this question ?"
  + "What do we want mathematically ?"
  + "What different tools do you think we could use ?"

For binary questions, I would sometimes ask the class to quickly vote
by show of hands, in order to see if some points were widely
understood or not, and ask the students for justifications. 

My goal was to highlight the mathematical reasoning required to be
able to pass the class: "What do we want, what do we need, what do we
have". I think by doing so, I could also create a class environment
where students were not shamed for not answering correctly.

However, I also found out that the first question I mentioned before:
"What do we want", was sometimes harder to find than expected.

** Reading indications

I encountered a recurrent issue with the students, where they would
not read the questions, or the indication in their entirety, and miss
some crucial hints.  They would then answer only the first part of the
question, or not use the key element given.

 In order to measure this, and mostly for awareness, I put a *special*
indication in some test, to see how many students would read and do it.
Fig. ref:fig:header shows the header of this test given during
class. During the distribution of the exam sheet, I reminded the
students to read carefully all the indications.

#+CAPTION: Header of a test
#+NAME: fig:header
[[./header.png]]

 Overall, less than half of the students did underline their last
name, as asked. This allowed me primarly to emphasize the fact that
despite what the students were saying, they did not read carefully the
indications. I would then refer to this little experiment often when
giving out exercises, or giving some advice for the final exam.

** Feedback on lectures
For my teaching in MAT104, where I was doing lectures and exercises
session (4h per week), I gave a feedback sheet at around midterm,
which is displayed Fig. ref:fig:questionnaire.


 #+CAPTION: Example of feedback sheet given in MAT104
 #+NAME:   fig:questionnaire
 [[./questionnaire_mat104.png]]


On Fig. ref:fig:feedback_results is shown the repartition of answers.
Among other results, a few can be singled out:
 + About a third of students felt that the lectures were going too fast (Q1)
 + For Q5, it seems that most of the students felt comfortable asking
   questions, either for a better understanding, or in order to go
   further in the topic.
 + Also, about a third of the students did not seem confident for the
   rest of the term in this course.

#+CAPTION: Results of the feedback sheet
#+NAME: fig:feedback_results
 [[./results_questionnaire.png]]

Based on those answers, we can understand that the students declared
to be comfortable in class, in the sense where they felt at ease to
express their questions and concerns. However, it appeared that they
had a problem with regards to the pace of the lectures, and more
precisely, their perception of the requirements in order to pass the
class.

 Part of this perception can be explained by the fact that for most of
students this course is the first math class after high-school, hence
the heterogenous level, vocabulary and notions mastered.

** Optional exercises

In order to overcome this, I offered facultative exercises, that would
not be corrected in class. Instead, I would correct them individually,
when they were sent by e-mail or on paper.

 Some were clearly labelled as "exam-like", while the others would
 range from "pure application from the lectures" to "more theoretical
 aspects and further knowledge". I felt however that the students who
 were handing out those optional exercises were the students that felt
 not confortable enough in their abilities, but were able to pass the
 class. Students who had more difficulties were not doing optional
 exercises.

** Optional "Discussion session"
One of the most interesting "concepts" I had the chance to see in
Denmark, was those "open discussion sessions", where TA would be
available to answer students questions.  I had the possibility to do
this for two classes: MAT104 and MIASHS.

For both of those classes, I advertised it as an *optional* session,
so that students who felt comfortable did not have to come.  First, we
listed the items in the curriculum which would be discussed, specific
lecture points, typical exercises. The reduced number of the students
and the more informal setting allow then to insist more on the
difficulties encountered. I found the students to be relieved at the
end of those sessions, as their concerns were adressed directly.

** Conclusion

All in all, I thought that the balance between finishing in time the
curriculums and providing a good support to the students is quite hard
in practice.  

I think that the optional exercises and sessions were very helpful to
the students: they would allow students to ask questions freely,
especially since the sessions were optional. For an optional Q&A
session in MIASHS, I had even students from other groups that came. I
also think that this informal setting helps in order to create a great
learning environment, and reassure students who did not felt
confident with the material.

* Lab work and inequalities

  I had the opportunity to follow some doctoral trainings, which were
  focused on inequalities and discrimination. Some of those aspects
  appeared for instance in STA301, which consisted in computer lab
  sessions focusing on the programming language R, and its use for
  statistics.
** Organisation of the lab sessions
Each week, the lab exercise sheet is uploaded, and the
students have to complete them. At the same time, the correction of
the exercises of the previous week were uploaded. 

Students would be in pairs, and on weeks 4 and 9 (out of 12), a
mini-test of 10 minutes was given with basic questions upon the use of
R. On week 5, the students had a graded lab session, meaning that they
had to write a report on the exercises given this week, with the code
executed, relevant plots and relevant comments. Finally, on the last
session, each student takes a 30 minutes exam.  For all of those, all
materials were available to the students (lecture notes, personal
documentation, previously uploaded code...) and except for the last
exam, all work is done by pairs.

The students are then required to be quite autonomous, as I would not
verify their work if they did not call me (except when students would
want to leave early).

 Occasionally, when the focus of the session was
more theoretical, I would give a short recap of the notions that they
should have seen during lectures.  To put is shortly, two different
skills were developed in these sessions:
 + How to be able to conduct simple statistical analysis
 + How to use the R programming language to conduct those analysis

Of course, if students went in the session not knowing at all the
points covered during the lectures, they would have a hard time doing
the exercises, leading to being resigned, or letting their partner do
most of the work.  On the other hand, some students would declare at
the first session that "computer science is not for them", and would
give up quite quickly.

** Tech-related skills

*** Access to a personal computer and reproducibility
    This course requires the use of a computer, with a R
    interpreter. The computers available in the classroom come with
    Rstudio installed, an IDE for R. Students did not have to come to
    class with their personal computer.  Due to this, to work on this
    course, students would have to read their own comments on what
    they have done previously, read the correction provided each week,
    or use the free access computers in the university buildings.  As
    a result, students would rarely work outside of the sessions, and
    many were unable to reproduce the results outside of the
    classroom.

    This would pose a problem for the graded lab session, as they were
    supposed to solve the different problems using R, and write a
    single-sheet report on those, and providing relevant plots, R
    commands and results. During these sessions, I insisted that the
    writing and formatting of the report should be kept as homework,
    while the statistical analysis per say should be done in class.

    This instruction was not always followed, and some pairs would not
    have finished with R at the end of the session.  Often, they would
    then use the results of other pairs in order to finish their
    reports

    This lead to some reports showing good commands, but bad
    results. Syntaxically wrong commands, but good results.  I suspect
    some students to have copied the good results, but not the right
    command.

*** Programming skills
    I could also notice a strong disparity between students who had
    some prior programming skills, or at least a certain experience
    with computers (the use of absolute/relative filepath especially).
    Without any prior exposition to programming, some of its logic can
    appear confusing, especially with R, that I personally find
    sometimes counterintuitive. Moreover, similarly to most of
    programming languages, the command are defined in english, and
    being proficient in english is a clear advantage.

    One example of this was the loading of data. The data to be
    analyzed was provided as .csv files, which were to be loaded into
    Rstudio. The instructions on the exercise sheets were to use
    relative paths, within a Rstudio project framework. Most students
    have not been able to load data consistently, and required my help
    every single time, even during the final exam. I wrote a
    cheatsheet in order to help students load data into Rstudio, as
    displayed Fig. ref:fig:loading_data_R.

** Communication skills
   As mentioned before, a report was asked for one of the
   sessions. This was a great exercise in order to synthesize what
   they should have learned. I covered before the issue of personal
   computers and reproducibility of the results. One other aspect was
   the writing of this report, in french. In statistics, the wording
   of questions is crucial, as a single comma, can lead to a
   misinterpretations, or ill-defined statistical tests. On the other
   hand being able to explain clearly statistical results is also
   tricky, for the same reasons.

   Some students who were not completely bilingual in french would
   sometimes be confused by the very specific wordings, and struggle
   to explain clearly their results. During the corrections, I tried
   then to not penalize too much possible misinsterpretation, and
   focus more on the reasoning provided by the students.
   
* Global overview and conclusion
  During my PhD, I had the opportunity to teach some classes, with
  different settings: lab sessions, lectures, exercises sessions.
  This allowed me to understand a new aspect of higher-education, and
  compare it to my previous experiences. It allowed me to have a
  reflexion on my teaching, especially through two angles:
   + the pedagogical aspect
   + the effect of inequalities among students

To circle back to the definition of teaching I defined section
[[sec:teaching]], I tried to focus on providing the students the
*relevant* learning materials, and to smooth out the technical
difficulties in the case of computer sessions.  I also focused on the
availability of resources, by being available to correct optional
exercises, or for optional Q&A sessions.

I also tried to develop the "mathematical intuition", by providing
first simple examples, or by favourising "hand-wavy" explanations
before dwelling into more grounded computations. 

Finally, I took particular care to prevent socio-economic inequalities
to affect the courses, by providing extra help to students in order
for them to focus more on statistical concepts than the pure
programming part of the course.

I only focused on some specific parts of my teaching experience, and a
lot more could also be imagined. However, as a PhD student, there is
some pressure to cover "at all cost" the whole curriculum, and some
pedagogical aspects are often overlooked. Moreover, the precarious
nature of teaching in the University renders some pedagogical
reflexion hard to put into place.
