This portfolio has been made in the context of the Research and
Teaching label of the [[https://doctorat.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/fr/pendant-la-these/la-formation-durant-la-these/parcours-labels/label-res-recherche-et-enseignement-superieur-577252.htm][Université Grenoble Alpes]], often shortened as
*RES label* in french.

* Introduction
 Labels of the UGA were implemented in order to offer a coherent set
of courses, tutorial and formal training to PhD students for their
future career whether in academia or in the industry.  This portfolio
is a personal document, that aims at describing what "teaching" means
to me, and how the actual hours spent in the classroom and in training
shaped my way of teaching, either volontarily, or not.  From september
2017 to december 2019, my teaching load summed to 136 hours in L1 and
L2 (first and second year students at the university), and are
summarized in the table below. A more precise feedback on those
courses will be introduced later.

As shown in the table above, all my teaching has been about
mathematics and statistics. In addition to the courses, I participated
in different doctoral training, directly linked to the teaching
methods.

In this portfolio, I will first discuss the role of the
teacher/lecturer at the university from my personal
experience. Afterward, I will describe more precisally

* Teaching from a personal point of view

** Teaching ?

  What does it mean to teach students ? For me, the definition would
take this form:

As a "specialist" in a certain field, how to transmit
the essential elements of a certain curriculum so that the students
are competent enough to get a passing grade for the course and be able
to tackle autonomously harder challenges of the curriculum".  This
definition highlights two different objectives, often linked:

  + Courses at the university have to be graded in order to measure in
    a sense the level of knowledge acquired by the students.
  + Courses are building blocks that help students define their own
    academic interest, and prepare them for their future career, in
    academia, the private sector or other.
  
    
In that sense, I judge important the fact that the course material
could/should aim at developing core competences, and intuition as
well.

** My own experience as a student
One particular fact about my own experience, is that before enrolling
as a PhD student at the UGA, I have never been part of the classical
french university. After my Baccalauréat, I spent two years in CPGE,
then two years in an "École d'Ingénieurs" (ECL). Afterward, to complete my
engineering degree, I enrolled for a double-degree at DTU (Danmarks
Tekniske Universitet) in Denmark. Those three different establishments
carried three different teaching methods: 
 - One approach very similar to high-school (CPGE).
 - One approach closer to french higher-education system (ECL).
 - One approach that I will qualify as discussion-based (DTU).
** Different teaching methods
 The first approach can be described as very school-like, with precise
 school classes, and few interactions between them. Due to the nature
 of the curriculum, especially with the regular oral interrogation
 sessions, each student could get quickly a feedback on its work and
 its progression. Keeping the same teachers for the whole year also
 means that students could adapt to the different teaching methods.


 In engineering school, the teachings are much more specialized,
 spanning a lot more subjects. This leads to a high number of teachers
 (in charge of lectures and tutorial/exercise sessions), and a high
 number of teaching assistants (in charge of tutorial/exercise
 sessions). From my own point-of-view, this led to gap between
 lectures and exercises. Most often than not, I recall that the TA had
 to recap the lectures, as students had a hard time distinguishing
 what was crucial for the tests, and what was out of scope. Of course,
 the sheer number of students enrolled renders an approach with closer
 feedback and links between lectures and exercises impossible.

 Finally, in Denmark, the organisation was slightly different. Most of
 the courses were scheduled in blocks of four hours, where the first
 two were dedicated to lectures, and the remaining was dedicated to an
 exercise session. During those sessions, the students were in fact
 almost completely autonomous, but could require help from the
 lecturer or from the teaching assistants at any point, if needed. I
 noticed that this autonomy helped some students, that could leave the
 class early if they felt like it, or could engage with the teacher or
 TA in some discussions. Those discussions felt very gratifying, as we
 could directly clarify some points in the lectures, or discuss some
 related topics.
** Some observations drawn from these experiences

From these experiences, I gathered that the engagement of the students
is very important in teaching, and that this engagement can come from
regular two-way feedbacks.

 For the teacher, it is important as it helps to see where the
students stand with respect to their comprehension of the curriculum,
or if they feel left behind or bored, and thus disengaging. More
precisely, the teacher can gauge if some points have been
misunderstood, or if some topics raise the curiosity of some students,
that could help motivate them.


From a student point of view, regular feedback from the teacher can
help to see if they are on track to pass the course, and if the
teacher takes into account those feedbacks, it can help improve the
teaching experience for everyone involved.

* 
As said earlier, I was a TA in some courses for exercises and lab
sessions. For one of those courses, it was an exercise session and a
lecture combined. All of those were with groups of approximately 30
students.

** Feedback on lectures
For my teaching in MAT104, where I was doing lectures and exercises
session (4h per week), I gave a feedback sheet at around midterm,
which is displayed Fig.ref:questionnaire
On ref:feedback_results is shown the repartition of answers: 
Among other results, a few can be singled out:
 + About a third of students felt that the lectures were going too fast (Q1)
 + For Q5, it seems that most of the students felt comfortable asking
   questions, either for a better understanding, or in order to go
   further in the topic.
 + Also, about a third of the students did not seem confident for the
   rest of the term in this course.
