\section{The CROCO model}

CROCO is a new oceanic modeling system built upon ROMS\_AGRIF and the non-hydrostatic kernel of SNH (under testing), gradually including algorithms from MARS3D (sediments)  and HYCOM (vertical coordinates). An important objective for CROCO is to resolve very fine scales (especially in the coastal area), and their interactions with larger scales. It is the oceanic component of a complex coupled system including various components, e.g., atmosphere, surface waves, marine sediments, biogeochemistry and ecosystems\footnote{taken from \url{http://www.croco-ocean.org/}}.

\subsection{Physical parametrization of the bottom friction}
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:quadratic_friction_vonkarman}
  (\tau_b^x, \tau_b^y) = C_d \sqrt{u_b^2 + v_b^2}(u_b, v_b) \\  
  C_d = \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
                 {\left(\frac{\kappa}{\log({\Delta z_b}/{r_z})}\right)}^2 & \text{for } C_d \in [C_d^{\min}, C_d^{\max}] \\
                 C_d^{\min} & \\
                 C_d^{\max}
       \end{array}
  \right. \\
  \kappa=0.41 \\  
\end{align}
